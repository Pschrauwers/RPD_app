<p>Adrian Johann Oliver was born March 16, 1984, at the former Grace Hospital in Vancouver, now the B.C. Women&rsquo;s Hospital and Health Centre. He arrived two months early and about seven minutes before his identical twin brother, Ben. Adrian weighed just three pounds, nine ounces. Ben was a little bigger at three pounds, 11 ounces. Their mother, 20-year-old Katherine Oliver, was flown to Vancouver by air ambulance from Williams Lake, B.C., where her husband, Joe, an RCMP officer, was stationed.</p>
<p>Adrian and Ben spent their first two months in side-by-side incubators in the neo-natal unit. Katherine stayed with them until they weighed five pounds and she could take them home. After that, Adrian and Ben were rarely apart.</p>
<p>They were bubbly sports-mad boys who played hockey, soccer, baseball, football and rugby. Katherine can&rsquo;t remember ever hearing them fight. &ldquo;You never thought of one without the other,&rdquo; she says. Six years later, another brother, Thomas, arrived and the twins took him under their wing. In 1989, Joe was transferred to Woodstock, N.B., and the family moved into a house right beside the RCMP detachment. The twins would watch the officers entering and leaving the building and pretend they were Mounties too.</p>
<p>As little kids, Adrian and Ben vowed to stay together forever. Katherine once overheard them in the bedroom, plotting their futures. &ldquo;They were going to live in the same apartment building when they grew up. One would live on one side, the other would live across the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1999, Joe was promoted to sergeant in the RCMP&rsquo;s customs and excise branch in Ottawa. The Olivers settled in Orleans, just east of the city, and the boys enrolled at St. Peter&rsquo;s High School. Adrian played left wing for the Rockland Nationals, a Junior C hockey team. His coach said he&rsquo;d never seen a player give so much effort.</p>
<p>The twins went on to Algonquin College and later Carleton University, where they both studied criminology. They shared every single class. Ben typically got the higher grades, &ldquo;but just by a bit.&rdquo; Everyone, it seemed, liked the boys with the movie-star good looks. One day, on the bus home from college, a modelling agent handed Adrian a business card. Soon, the twins were flying to the U.S. and Europe on modelling shoots. They never intended to model forever, and their parents were urging them to find more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; careers. In 2006, Adrian and Ben wrote the RCMP entrance exams&mdash;together.</p>
<p>Ben was accepted first and headed to the RCMP training depot in Regina. It was the twins&rsquo; only time apart. When Adrian arrived six months later, some teachers mistook him for Ben. In Regina, Adrian met Shelagh Mitchell, a cadet from Kelowna, B.C. On her first day, he was part of a troop showing newcomers the ropes. When it was Adrian&rsquo;s turn to speak, his classmates exploded into laughter, Shelagh says. &ldquo;You could tell that everyone just loved him.&rdquo; Adrian blushed and bent his head. Two months later, he asked her out.</p>
<p>Shelagh saw the bond between Adrian and Ben. &ldquo;You could not get in between those two,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That relationship had to be respected because it was so strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After graduation, Adrian was assigned to the Surrey detachment in B.C.&rsquo;s Lower Mainland. Shelagh got a job in the Burnaby detachment, where Ben had been working for nearly a year.</p>
<p>Adrian and Shelagh moved into a townhouse beside Burnaby&rsquo;s Deer Park. Ben was a frequent visitor. The twins jogged in the park and worked out at the Burnaby detachment&rsquo;s gym. Those were happy years, Ben and Shelagh say.</p>
<p>Adrian took his job seriously, Ben says. He relished the grittier aspects of beat work&mdash;the drunken brawls and domestic squabbles&mdash;that drive some officers to desk jobs. He thought it was important &ldquo;to be able to walk into a house where people have problems and be able to resolve them.&rdquo; But he also had a playful, &ldquo;goofy&rdquo; streak, Shelagh says. &ldquo;If I was cooking in the kitchen, he&rsquo;d grab me and would make me two-step and spin. He was always in a good mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months ago, a unit opened up in their complex. Ben moved in right beside his brother, just as they&rsquo;d always planned.</p>
<p>On the morning of Nov. 13, Adrian was on duty in Surrey, winding down a 12-hour shift. He was on the lookout for a stolen pickup truck and was driving his unmarked vehicle above the speed limit when he collided with a transport truck. He died at the scene. </p>
