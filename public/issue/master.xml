    <p>A calendar always seems more enticing in January than at any other time of the year.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond its roles as practical Christmas gift and personalized wall adornment, a new calendar offers a fresh look at the coming year uncluttered by appointments, meetings or other obligations. It contains only possibilities.</p>
    
    <p>At Maclean&rsquo;s, we see the coming year in exactly the same way: as a new opportunity to provide 12 more months of current affairs, politics, opinion and entertainment to readers across the country.</p>
    
    <p>Certainly 2012 offered a remarkable array of news and events. There was the pageantry of Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee and the excitement of the London Summer Olympics. At home, divisions over resource politics and trade, ever-present economic worries and the formidable new leader of the federal NDP dominated the political landscape. The international arena saw continued upheaval in the Middle East, a horrific school shooting in Connecticut, a superstorm on the East Coast and a dramatic and consequential United States presidential election.</p>
    
    <p>It was, in other words, another interesting year. And Maclean&rsquo;s played a leading role in many of Canada&rsquo;s biggest stories. Shortly after we gave readers an exclusive look at Omar Khadr&rsquo;s interview with an American forensic psychiatrist (&ldquo;The Secret Khadr File,&rdquo; Oct. 1, 2012), the convicted terrorist was flown from Guant&aacute;namo Bay to Canada. Other media outlets specifically acknowledged our role in the timing of Khadr&rsquo;s repatriation. Our inaugural Power List (&ldquo;The 25 most important people in Ottawa,&rdquo; Dec. 3, 2012), which named the real power brokers in and behind the federal government, set tongues to wagging throughout the capital.</p>
    
    <p>And in Quebec, evidence uncovered at the Charbonneau inquiry revealed the deep and shocking vein of corruption running throughout the government in that province. This came as no surprise to Maclean&rsquo;s readers, who will recall our early efforts to blow the whistle on Quebec&rsquo;s corruption problem (&ldquo;The Most Corrupt Province in Canada,&rdquo; Oct. 4, 2010). For our trouble, we were publicly attacked by federal and provincial politicians.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, making sense of a confusing and conflicted world is what quality journalism is all about. At Maclean&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re proud to be entering our 108th year of providing Canadians with all the necessary information and unflinching analysis they need to understand the situation around them.</p>
    
    <p>The media world is also changing rapidly, and the magazine along with it. Maclean&rsquo;s released its first ebook in 2012&mdash;an in-depth look at Prime Minister Stephen Harper by political editor Paul Wells&mdash;and followed that with another dozen or so, on topics as diverse as the Shafia family murders, Scientology and the death of a Canadian mountain climber on Mt. Everest. (Of course, there&rsquo;s also one of our most recent: humour columnist Scott Feschuk&rsquo;s wry look at the holidays in all their absurdity.)</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we expanded our digital magazine platform this year to include Android devices as well as iPads. We launched a new iPhone app that gives readers the full magazine plus online features and up-to-the-minute news from macleans.ca. For these and other efforts we won gold awards in news, social media and cross-platform programming at the Canadian Online Publishing Awards this past October, in addition to our gold and two silvers at the National Magazine Awards.</p>
    
    <p>We&rsquo;re gratified that readers have responded. Despite tough times for other media outlets, according to the respected Audit Bureau of Circulation, Maclean&rsquo;s readership has been increasing. We now boast 2,474,000 total weekly readers; among the 18-to-34-year-old demographic that&rsquo;s supposedly lost interest in conventional media, our readership has held steady at 25 per cent.</p>
    
    <p>So what will 2013 hold? More of everything.</p>
    
    <p>In Canada, the new year means a new leader for the federal Liberal party, a new governor of the Bank of Canada, a new premier in Ontario and a provincial election in British Columbia. We will also discover whether fallen high-tech darling RIM can turn itself around and whether we&rsquo;ll see NHL hockey in the near future. Outside our borders, a fractured U.S. government will continue to struggle with its budget woes, Europe will face major issues of solidarity, Iran will continue trying to destabilize the Middle East and we&rsquo;ll find out what happens to everyone else when China&rsquo;s rapid growth slows down.</p>
    
    <p>With the world in flux and full of contradictory arguments and thorny dilemmas, the need for top-notch writing, clear-headed observation and the ability to uncover what&rsquo;s truly significant and noteworthy becomes more pressing than ever. Maclean&rsquo;s continues to take this responsibility of high-quality journalism very seriously. In 2013 we&rsquo;ll be offering more stories, more cutting-edge photography and more special editions on more platforms and devices than ever before. We hope you&rsquo;ll make room for Maclean&rsquo;s on your calendar in the new year. </p>

    <p>A thousand words</p>
    
    <p>When I picked up my copy of <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> Year in Pictures (Dec. 24) and saw that little boy&rsquo;s beaming face on the front cover, my heart jumped with delight. It put a big, happy smile on my face to see how the heart of a child at play cannot be held down by the imposing and sombre world around him. Thank you for reminding me that in the heart of child lives hope and wonder and joy.</p>
    
    <p><em>Marjonneke Grech, Burlington, Ont.</em></p>
    
    <p>There and everywhere</p>
    
    <p>Martin Patriquin&rsquo;s report on the Quebec construction industry (&ldquo;The foundation of corruption,&rdquo; National, Jan. 7) is one of the best-written and -researched articles I have ever read. I worked in the construction industry for most of my career across Canada, including Quebec. All that Patriquin described can easily happen if you have a system, and people, who are so readily prepared to line their pockets.</p>
    
    <p><em>Mike Ryan, Summerside, P.E.I.</em></p>
    
    <p>Give it a royal rest</p>
    
    <p>I very much look forward to receiving my <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> every week. I know that I will be educated, infuriated, entertained and confused. With so many important issues facing Canada and the world today, I &#64257;nd it laughable and annoying that 17 or so pages have been allocated to nothing more than a glorified gossip section displaying rehashed paparazzi photos of the British royals&rsquo; baby pictures throughout the decades (&ldquo;The royal baby album,&rdquo; Royal Baby, Dec. 24). Please, get back to the formula that makes <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> so great: thought-provoking articles on relevant topics, not a picture show of a barely pregnant princess.</p>
    
    <p><em>David Cuviello, Welland, Ont.</em></p>
    
  
    <p>I love it when <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> features those gigantic spreads on the royal family, 25 pages this time. By omitting this section it gives me more time to spend with my own family&mdash;something that really matters.</p>
    
    <p><em>John Gatsis, Toronto</em></p>
    
    <p>Winners and losers</p>
    
    <p>As a hockey fan, I too have a tremendous amount of dislike for Gary Bettman and Donald Fehr. But to include them in your list of &ldquo;newsmaker villains&rdquo; (&ldquo;Rogues&rsquo; Gallery,&rdquo; Newsmakers, Dec. 17)&mdash;with a pedophile, several murderers and two insane presidents of war-torn countries&mdash;is surely excessive! </p>
    
    <p><em>Patrick Nelson, Toronto</em></p>
    
 
    
    <p>The behaviour of Paul Watson, the founder of animal rights group Sea Shepherd, who was arrested for an attack on shark hunters, is the nautical equivalent of a vegan driving on the wrong side of the road to force a truck carrying beef into a ditch. Not all the lives he risks are his to risk.</p>
    
    <p><em>Stuart Mills, Fredericton, N.B.</em></p>
    
    <p>You included transgendered beauty pageant contestant Jenna Talackova in the &ldquo;defeated&rdquo; category of your Newsmakers issue (&ldquo;Down and out,&rdquo; Newsmakers, Dec. 17). But that was no defeat: she was allowed to compete and, as you point out, she went on to win Miss Congeniality. That seems to be a great victory for Talackova and for the transgender community as a whole.</p>
    
    <p><em>Logan Burris, Calgary</em></p>
    
    <p>The sound and the glory</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for the intelligent and interesting article on the rise of young, charismatic pipe organists (&ldquo;The key to survival,&rdquo; Music, Jan. 7). However, I was disappointed that the story gave such short shrift to the beautiful music still offered in thousands of churches every Sunday by &ldquo;blue-haired church marms&rdquo; and greybeards like myself. Good church organ-playing and the community singing that it supports so well are a lot like hockey on natural ice: not as common as it used to be, but a joyful relief from our passive, dollar-driven, star-obsessed society. They take us somewhere different, and good.</p>
    
    <p><em>David Berry, Victoria </em></p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s a wild world</p>
    
    <p>While I heartily applaud Ken MacQueen&rsquo;s interview with Jim Sterba, author of <em>Nature Wars</em> (Interview, Dec. 24), it still makes me want to tear my hair that so many people need to be told that Bambi is not real. The wild is not a &ldquo;warm and fuzzy&rdquo; place. Predators who are not hunted by humans lose their fear of us. Problems with marauding predators are not caused by &ldquo;human encroachment on their territory,&rdquo; as many like to claim. The cougars and bears are multiplying to the point where they are encroaching on territory we settled long ago. Here on Vancouver Island we have the densest populations of wolves and cougars in the world; attacks on livestock are, unfortunately, not rare (often the predator doesn&rsquo;t even eat what it killed) and every few years a cougar pounces on a human. Yes, wolves, bears and cougars are beautiful and magni&#64257;cent. We have plenty of them. Hunters are stewards of the wild. We need more hunters. Ask any farmer!</p>

    <p>Drug report</p>
    
    <p>I thought Anne Kingston&rsquo;s article &ldquo; &lsquo;A national embarrassment&rsquo; &rdquo; (National, Nov. 26) was the best I have ever read concerning the prescription drug problem. And it was just another example of your excellent magazine, which I have subscribed to for over 20 years. Please keep up the good reporting.</p>

    <p>Fighting the fighter jets</p>
    
    <p>There is a great deal of misinformation making the rounds on the F-35 costs as a potential acquisition by Canada (&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a silver lining in the cloudy F-35 fiasco,&rdquo; From the Editors, Jan. 7). What appear to be huge cost escalations are really discrepancies of not comparing apples to apples. The initial cost to buy 65 F-35 airplanes was $9 billion. With minor escalations, that is still the case. Initially, the lifespan of the airplanes was considered to be 20 years. The total operating cost over that period was estimated to be about $11 billion, added to the $9 billion for the hardware came to $20 billion. Some considered a 20-year lifespan too short. It was extended to 30 years, adding another $10 billion. KPMG noted that the CF-18 has been in service for 40 years. They expanded the estimated lifespan for the F-35 to 42 years, adding another $15 billion for a total of $45 billion. This is not a case of a huge cost overrun. It costs about $9 billion to buy 65 airplanes and about $36 billion to run an air force for the next 42 years to operate the airplanes.</p>
    
    <p><em>Peter Scholz, Georgetown, Ont.</em></p>
    
 
    
    <p>There is no silver lining in the F-35 fiasco! You comment that &ldquo;only $335 million has been spent&rdquo; so far on the F-35 program, and admit it is a lot of money but a paltry sum compared with the $45 billion for the entire F-35 purchase. Yet $335 million is an exorbitant, inexcusable amount, especially during this recessionary period. And does that include the cost that KPMG billed Stephen Harper for their services, which simply veri&#64257;ed what the opposition parties, the parliamentary committees, the parliamentary budget officer and the federal auditor general have been warning us about all along?</p>
    
    <p><em>Vasco Piccinin, Sudbury, Ont.</em></p>
    
 
    
    <p>While the government clearly &ldquo;stonewalled and obfuscated&rdquo; in the F-35 fiasco, the parliamentary budget officer has been equally less than straightforward in trying to blue-sky the aircraft&rsquo;s costs over 40 years. To try to determine&mdash;guess, really&mdash;these total costs, including in&#64258;ation, one would have to include everything necessary for the lifetime combat effectiveness of each aircraft, including total maintenance, all required tools and equipment, the price of fuel and fees for total aircrew and ground crew costs. Not only are the long-term estimates ridiculous, they would be about the same for any competitive aircraft. All that is really required is the combat-ready initial purchase price of each aircraft, including special equipment unique to each model and to the maintenance of such special equipment. All else is just pie in the sky.</p>
    
    <p><em>Alexander McKay, Calgary</em></p>
    
    <p>The world inventory of weaponry can already kill the Earth&rsquo;s population many times over. Where is the proof of need for more? What countries are we &ldquo;defending&rdquo; against that 65 jets and a few warships could stop? Why not instead arm our forces with all that is necessary to heal the wounded, to help those displaced by war? If we need an excuse to do this necessary work, think of the many friends we would cultivate worldwide as a defence against our imagined enemies.</p>

    <p>No sex in the mosque, please</p>
    
    <p>
      <em>A mosque is a place of worship for all local Muslims to come together and pray together (&ldquo;Rise of gay mosques,&rdquo; International, Jan. 7). The purpose of a mosque, and any place of worship, is to unite mankind in faith. It is not a place to discuss sexuality. To build separate mosques based upon one&rsquo;s sexuality defeats the purpose of a mosque, which is to negate one&rsquo;s own self and instead focus upon the omnipotent Creator.</em>

    <p>If only it were that easy</p>
    
    <p>While I too admire Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s latest cinematic feat, I cannot agree with Preston Manning&rsquo;s interpretation of the lessons <em>Lincoln</em> offers sitting politicians (&ldquo;Lessons from <em>Lincoln</em>,&rdquo; International, Dec. 24). Our politicians would be hard-pressed to find inspiration in the post-Civil War period. The surrender at Appomattox, Va., did not signal the start of reunification as Manning claims. When the Northern troops were withdrawn in 1877, recently readmitted Southern states were free to impose segregation, and they did so with impunity into the 1960s&mdash;when (again) the National Guard was sent in to oversee desegregation. Lastly, readers of Manning&rsquo;s commentary should be mindful that between the Civil War and 1960, some 5,000 (a conservative estimate) African-Americans died at the hands of vigilantes who resisted the imposition of the three amendments to the constitution granting African-Americans their freedom and rights as citizens. </p>

    <p>Corrections</p>
    
    <p>In the <em>Newsmakers</em> section of our Dec. 17 issue, Alberta Premier Alison Redford was referred to as a single mom. This is incorrect. <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> regrets the error.</p>
    
     
    <p>A photo accompanying &ldquo;In the lobby&rdquo; (Power List, Dec. 3) showed a woman holding a sign for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) next to an item about the World Society for the Protection of Animals Canada, which has no relationship with PETA.</p>

    <p>Change is coming</p>
    
    <p>Syria is on the brink of change, as the head of President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s military police defected to what he describes as the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Revolution,&rdquo; while Assad&rsquo;s last ally of influence, Russia&rsquo;s Vladimir Putin, says that &ldquo;a change in leadership&rdquo; is imminent. Questions remain about Islamist groups jockeying to replace Assad. But the short-term goal is to end the bloodshed, and for that to happen, Assad must go. Mercifully, it&rsquo;s no longer a question of if, but when.</p>
    
    <p>No free lunches</p>
    
    <p>Is sanity creeping into the executive suite? Last week, Apple revealed that CEO Tim Cook&rsquo;s compensation has been cut by nearly 99 per cent in 2012, to a comfortable $4.17 million, as the company&rsquo;s stock price continued to slide. Goldman Sachs&mdash;oft criticized for lavish executive pay&mdash;has cut the salaries of senior staff in London by 50 per cent, while the National Australia Bank agreed to tie executive pay to company performance. The world&rsquo;s corporate elite have not yet restored the trust they broke by taking massive payouts during the recession. Now, at least, they have examples to follow. </p>
    
    <p>Choked Cherry</p>
    
    <p>The longer the NHL lockout drags on, the better Don Cherry gets at Twitter. The irascible former coach used the social medium to give Russian hockey star Nail Yakupov a well-deserved tongue lashing for saying, on the eve of the world junior championship, that Canada &ldquo;plays dirty.&rdquo; Canadians, Cherry noted acidly, allowed Yakupov to hone his game in its junior system, adding: &ldquo;We treat him royally, give him great coaching so he can go number one overall [in the NHL draft] and he calls us dirty.&rdquo; We couldn&rsquo;t have tweeted it better.</p>
    
    <p>Hey baby, nice dewlap</p>
    
    <p>Props to the Nature Conservancy of Canada for its newly announced campaign to buy a strip of land on the Chignecto Isthmus so moose from New Brunswick can mate with those from Nova Scotia. The so-called &ldquo;Moose Sex Project&rdquo; might not be what economists have in mind when they advocate a Maritime union. But relations between the two provinces are not what they should be (you can&rsquo;t sell Nova Scotia cheese, for example, in New Brunswick), and hey, you have to start somewhere.</p>

  <p>Over the edge</p>
  
  <p>The week was filled with concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff and the impact its automatic tax hikes and $110 billion in annual spending cuts would have on the economy. But the brinkmanship over those amounts seemed almost absurd in a country that runs $1-trillion deficits. Next month, the U.S. will have to raise its debt ceiling again. A similar move in 2011 led to a downgrading of its credit rating. America can no longer afford to pay its bills, and its reputation among lenders is on shaky ground. The U.S. needs to get its house in order and, unfortunately, the fiscal cliff became more of a diversion than the wake-up call it was meant to be.</p>
  
   <p>An empty win</p>
    
    <p>That Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi should go ahead with an ill-advised power grab behind the fig leaf of a referendum is bad enough. That a mere 30 per cent of eligible voters participated in his sham&mdash;most having stayed away from the polls out of disgust&mdash;weakens Morsi&rsquo;s mandate further. Far from the tool Morsi&rsquo;s Muslim Brotherhood claims it needs to solidify the gains of the Arab Spring, the referendum outcome practically guarantees future unrest. Evidently, Egypt&rsquo;s journey to democracy has just begun.</p>
    
 
    
    <p>If you build it, they won&rsquo;t come</p>
    
    <p>Are we Canadians losing touch with our identity as rugged winter-lovers? In Toronto, the first snowstorm of the season unleashed traffic mayhem&mdash;though it was forecast for days and fell in the middle of the Christmas break. In Calgary, a giant rink built by a man who invited one and all to skate for free went unused. Norm Price even set up hockey nets and brought out hot chocolate&mdash;all to no avail. Fans of the frozen game, it seems, would rather play it on a Nintendo.</p>
    
    <p>Losing their Spidey senses </p>
    
    <p>It was fun to see Tolkien fans back in costume for the opening of <em>The Hobbit</em>, but it&rsquo;s a sign that geek culture has gotten out of hand when the author of Spider-Man issue No. 700, Dan Slott, receives death threats for killing the superhero&rsquo;s alter ego, Peter Parker. Yes, fantasies and comics are all about immersing oneself in alternate worlds. But Spider-Man is a story, and Parker a character. Besides which, do they really believe he&rsquo;s gone for good?</p>

    <p>Out of this world</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s official: there is nothing Chris Hadfield can&rsquo;t do. High school scholar? Check. Elite fighter pilot? Check. First Canadian to walk in space? Check. And now, just days into his mission as the inaugural Canadian commander of the International Space Station, Had&#64257;eld has set the standard yet again&mdash;recording the &#64257;rst-ever song from space. Dressed in khaki shorts and a pair of grey tube socks, the Sarnia, Ont., native strummed an acoustic guitar while orbiting the Earth. His song of choice? <em>Jewel in the Night</em>, a Christmas tune written by his brother Dave Hadfield: &ldquo;Wherever we go / In all of the wonders above / With all that we bring / There&rsquo;s no finer thing / Than this message, this promise of love.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Private shot, public spat</p>
    
    <p>Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings can be utterly infuriating&mdash;even for a Zuckerberg. Randi Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, flew into a Twitter rage when she discovered that a marketing director named Callie Schweitzer had tweeted one of her private photos. It was &ldquo;way uncool,&rdquo; she charged. But it turned out Schweitzer didn&rsquo;t actually breach any of the website&rsquo;s privacy rules; she and Zuckerberg simply shared a mutual friend, and that&rsquo;s how the photo came to light. Still, Randi used the public spat as an opportunity to lecture the world about the etiquette of online sharing. &ldquo;Always ask permission before posting a friend&rsquo;s photo publicly,&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about privacy settings, it&rsquo;s about human decency.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>In her footsteps</p>
    
    <p>America has its Kennedys. India can&rsquo;t seem to move beyond the Gandhis. And now Pakistan has a firmly entrenched political dynasty of its own. Five years to the day after Benazir Bhutto&rsquo;s assassination, her son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, announced his arrival on Pakistan&rsquo;s political stage. &ldquo;However many Bhuttos you kill, more Bhuttos will emerge,&rdquo; said the 24-year-old, marking a third generation of Bhuttos in politics. Dynasties elsewhere continue pushing their sons to the political fore. In January, red-haired lawyer Joe Kennedy III will head to Washington after winning a seat in Congress. And 42-year-old Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Gandhi dynasty that has dominated Indian politics almost since independence, remains the Congress party&rsquo;s most likely prime ministerial candidate. </p>
    
    <p>Safe at home</p>
    
    <p>Back in 2003, he was one of baseball&rsquo;s best relief pitchers, a dominant closer for a Florida Marlins club that upset the New York Yankees in a stunning World Series. Two years later, Ugueth Urbina was in a Venezuelan jail cell, accused of attacking two workers on the family farm with a machete and dousing them in gasoline for trespassing. The crime was shocking&mdash;but not entirely unprovoked. Months earlier, his mother, Maura Villarreal, was kidnapped for ransom by bandits and held hostage for five months until she was freed by police. So Urbina had ample reason to lash out at someone snooping around his property. Convicted of attempted murder and originally sentenced to 14 years in prison, he was unexpectedly released last week, more than eight years early. For good behaviour.</p>
    
    <p>A lone voice</p>
    
    <p>Since the Islamic Republic was established three decades ago, only one woman has ever served as an Iranian cabinet minister: Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi. She is now a former member of cabinet. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sacked his outspoken health minister after Dastjerdi had the gall to criticize her male colleagues for failing to pay for the import of crucial medication. A gynecologist by trade, she complained on state television that while there is money to import &ldquo;luxury cars,&rdquo; the cash earmarked for medicine is nowhere to be found. </p>
    
    <p>Unpresidential </p>
    
    <p>Jacob Zuma suffered another attack of foot-in-mouth syndrome&mdash;right after being voted in for a second term as leader of the African National Congress. In his first speech since, Zuma told black South Africans they should never try to behave like whites, and that buying a pet dog is part of &ldquo;white culture.&rdquo; So too, he added, is walking dogs and spending money on veterinary bills when those dogs get sick. In response, black South Africans began posting photos of themselves on Twitter being &ldquo;un-African&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. walking their dogs. Read one tweet: &ldquo;Zuma says owning dogs is un-African. Unlike those old African traditions of owning German cars, Italian suits and Irish whisky.&rdquo; Zuma, who in August said it was &ldquo;not right&rdquo; for women to be single, and once claimed minorities have fewer rights &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s how democracy works,&rdquo; remains massively popular in South Africa, where ailing former president Nelson Mandela&mdash;who owned a Rhodesian ridgeback&mdash;was released from hospital last week.</p>

    <p>There are helicopter parents. And then there&rsquo;s David and Julie Ireland. The Kansas couple was so obsessed with keeping tabs on their 21-year-old daughter while she was away at school that they secretly installed electronic tracking software on her computer so they could read her emails and monitor her social media accounts. Mom and dad would show up unannounced and follow her around campus, and harassed University of Cincinnati officials about forcing their daughter into treatment for drugs and mental illness. The incessant stalking reached such absurd levels that Aubrey Ireland had no choice but to take her parents to court and demand a restraining order. A judge agreed. If either parent tries to contact her before September, they could face criminal charges. It was &ldquo;like I was a dog with a collar on,&rdquo; Aubrey said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just been really embarrassing and upsetting.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Child&rsquo;s play</p>
    
    <p>Sorry, Russian orphans: President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens, a blow to Moscow-Washington relations that will also leave children stranded in Russia just as they were about to go to a new home. To gain public support for the bill, Russian TV aired sensational stories about children being taken to America for lurid purposes, like organ harvesting. In truth, the law was Putin&rsquo;s way of striking back against the U.S. government for a recent law targeting Russian human rights violators.</p>
    
    <p>Hungry for change</p>
    
    <p>Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence has drawn worldwide attention to the sorry state of Canada&rsquo;s First Nations communities with her hunger strike aimed at securing a summit with the Prime Minister and the Governor General. But with attention comes scrutiny, and some are asking why the First Nations leader from northern Ontario appeared to be raising money as part of her campaign. The official Facebook page of Spence&rsquo;s strike invited donors to give to a bank account bearing the name of the chief&rsquo;s partner, Clayton Kennedy. Spence&rsquo;s connection to Kennedy has caused her problems in the past: when she was a deputy chief, he was appointed co-manager of Attawapiskat, though she said she recused herself from any discussion of his hiring. </p>
    
    <p>The ultimate phony</p>
    
    <p>Two days after Adam Lanza stormed into Sandy Hook elementary school and opened fire, his so-called &ldquo;Uncle Jonathan&rdquo; showed up at a memorial site in Newtown, Conn., and started telling reporters that his &ldquo;nephew&rdquo; was popping an antipsychotic drug. Uncle Jonathan was actually Jonathan Lee Riches, a notorious imposter who spends most of his time filing bogus lawsuits against public figures, from Britney Spears to George W. Bush to Martha Stewart. (In one suit, he claimed to have bumped into Kanye West and Kim Kardashian at an al-Qaeda training camp.) Today, the 35-year-old is back behind bars, charged with violating probation.</p>
    
    <p>Too cool for school</p>
    
    <p>Billionaire philanthropist <em>Seymour Schulich</em> knows a thing or two about making money and giving it away. So, after watching high-profile clashes over large donations to universities and academic freedoms, he worries that donor chill could set in. In one dispute, faculty at the universities of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier objected to a partnership with <em>Jim Balsillie&rsquo;s</em> Centre for International Governance Innovation, while Carleton University was in a fight over a gift from Calgary oil baron <em>Clay Riddell</em>. Even as groups representing schools and profs try to hammer out donor deals that avoid problems in the future, Schulich says donors may look for other causes to support instead of universities: &ldquo;Why would you be inclined to expose yourself to criticism?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Welsh immersion </p>
    
    <p>Can a person learn a language and not know it? So it seems in the curious case of Alun Morgan, an 81-year-old Englishman who suffered a stroke and woke up three weeks later able to speak Welsh. Morgan had been evacuated to Wales during the Second World War, yet never learned the U.K. nation&rsquo;s distinct Celtic tongue before he left at age 10. Or so he thought: doctors have since diagnosed him with aphasia, a form of brain damage which causes a shift in the brain&rsquo;s language centre, leaving victims with speech impairment or, in very rare cases, a foreign accent. Experts believe the Welsh must have sunk into his subconscious, to be unlocked by the stroke seven decades  later.   </p>
    
 
    <p>Ringside to courtside </p>
    
    <p>Rapper Chris Brown is still on probation for a vicious 2009 assault against his then-girlfriend and fellow singer, Rihanna. But the star-crossed couple appear to have reconciled, attending a Lakers game on Christmas Day. Brown also had a tattoo removed recently: the name of another girl, Karrueche Tran.</p>

  <body.content>
    <p>So, Stephen Harper, what would you do if a brutal Middle Eastern dictator used chemical weapons against his own people?</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;To be blunt about it, any military intervention in this part of the world, any talk of that, should be undertaken with great caution,&rdquo; the Prime Minister told Global News anchor Dawna Friesen in a year-end interview. &ldquo;There are enormous dangers here, enormous risks.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s year-end interviews are always worth close reading. Partly because he gives few interviews. Partly because those interviews, widely spaced, show how his thinking changes as circumstances do. This year the changes are stark.</p>
    
    <p>The part I&rsquo;ve just quoted came when Friesen asked Harper about the possibility that Bashar al-Assad might use chemical weapons against Syrian opponents of his regime.</p>
    
    <p>Would NATO intervene? &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to speculate.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Is the use of what we used to call weapons of mass destruction a &ldquo;red line,&rdquo; as the Obama administration has called it? That was the question that got Harper talking about risks and caution. &ldquo;What we can continue to do, as I say, is try to work with elements of the opposition and others to try to push that country to a better solution and try to avoid further escalation of this conflict.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>This is what being Prime Minister does to you. A decade ago, when conversation turned to the use of chemical or biological weapons and the theatre was Iraq, it was Jean Chr&eacute;tien talking about risks and caution and Harper urging red lines. I dare hope we&rsquo;ll never get to test the hypothetical in Syria, but it was not only when it came to Assad that this year&rsquo;s Harper was notably less cocky than previous years&rsquo;. Chastened, one might say, by a year when the world turned out to be more complex than advertised.</p>
    
    <p>A year ago, Harper gave his big year-end interview to Friesen&rsquo;s competitor, CTV&rsquo;s Lisa LaFlamme, and he was quick to explain how eventful the year ahead would be. &ldquo;I want to make sure that we use it,&rdquo; he said then about his first majority government. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many majority governments, the bureaucracy talks them into going to sleep for three years, and then they all of a sudden realize they&rsquo;re close to an election.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Harper now counts himself lucky if he wins more days than he loses. &ldquo;I try to be as well briefed on a range of subjects as I can,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in an era&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like the movie <em>Lincoln,</em> where we&rsquo;re deciding the Civil War and we&rsquo;re deciding slavery.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in an era where there&rsquo;s a whole lot of decisions that have to be made. And it really is the culmination of getting most of those things right. So I try to work hard, be well briefed on subject matter. I encourage my cabinet ministers and my caucus to do the same thing so that we make more decisions right than we do wrong. Because inevitably we&rsquo;re not going to get everything right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not perfect.&nbsp;We can&rsquo;t see the future.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Quite a contrast between this Harper and the one who told Ken Whyte, in this magazine a month after the 2011 election, that &ldquo;the real defining moments for the country and for the world are those big conflicts where everything&rsquo;s at stake and where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side.&rdquo; He named the 20th-century fights against fascism and Communism.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;You suggest that we are in one great conflict, or we&rsquo;re heading to one,&rdquo; Whyte said.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I think we always are,&rdquo; Harper replied.</p>
    
    <p>But that was then. These days he&rsquo;s less interested in running off at the mouth. This year the what-will-you-do-with-your-majority question came from Shan Chandrasekar, the president of ATN, the Asian Television Network, with 33 channels in nine languages. &ldquo;Our agenda does not change,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We told people in three elections now what it is we&rsquo;re going to do, and that&rsquo;s what we do.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>What happened since a year ago? In a word, China. Harper ended 2011 angry at Barack Obama for delaying the Keystone XL project and eager to move toward China as an energy market. He spent 2012 discovering that was more easily said than done; that China would want to play by its own rules, rules Canadians might not like; and that trumpeting his goals was the same as giving opponents a target.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;There is no better place than India,&rdquo; he told Chandrasekar. &ldquo;There is no developed country and developing country that are a better match&rdquo; than Canada and India. On one level he was saying, your audience is Indo-Canadian, let me flatter them. On another it was, &ldquo;China was no cakewalk.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Are his plans themselves less ambitious? I think not. He introduced two omnibus budget-implementation bills in 2012, each hundreds of pages of pent-up deregulatory zeal. The opposition was powerless to block them, the press gallery distracted by the daily circus. He will be able to introduce as many as six more like them before a 2015 election. He was reminded in 2012 that he can&rsquo;t control the world. But he still controls the House of Commons. For most of his plans he needs nothing more.</p>

    <hedline>Let the monkey go home</hedline>

    <p>Personally speaking, I wouldn&rsquo;t want a monkey for a pet although Darwin, the seven- month-old rhesus macaque captured Dec. 9 in a Toronto Ikea parking lot is appealing. Far more I might say than the live rat on the shoulder of a woman in Lake Worth, Fla., near where I lived once, who wore it every weekend. Unlike pet rats, pet monkeys are forbidden in Toronto. The city&rsquo;s bylaws are numerous (183,000), with amendments electronically updated. If it&rsquo;s chickens you want to raise or a tree cut down, the City of Toronto will say no or make it damn difficult. </p>
    
    <p>Darwin has belonged to a Ms. Yasmin Nakhuda, a real estate lawyer, since he was six weeks old. She underestimated the opposable thumb primates share with us and so when her car was parked at a north Toronto Ikea, Darwin undid his crate, opened the vehicle door and went out. Along came Toronto&rsquo;s famed animal control officers&mdash;famed in my experience for their total lack of empathy for animals&mdash;and took him away. Fair enough. You can&rsquo;t leave a seven-month-old anything wandering about a parking lot in December, even though he did have his coat on. When Ms. Nakhuda came to claim him, she got a $240 fine and a form in which she signed away rights to Darwin. Big mistake. She claims they talked about criminal action and I am not entirely disbelieving. But when you lose a pet, you tend to lose a lot of other things including rationality. </p>
    
    <p>Darwin has been relocated to a primate care facility called Story Book Farm outside Toronto which takes in such lost souls&mdash;monkeys who have been commandeered for lab research or just dumped by roadside zoos. Bravo to Story Book Farm. Nothing wrong with them using Darwin&rsquo;s celebrity to raise funds&mdash;please donate. Still, Yasmin wants Darwin back and one can&rsquo;t help feeling that a collection of traumatized monkeys on the mend is not necessarily a better home for Darwin than hers where he runs free like a family member. Ms. Nakhuda suggested Darwin choose but the judge who heard her petition, no Solomon he, put the case over to January. </p>
    
    <p>To strengthen the rationale for this pet grab, parties at interest issued stern warnings. Rhesus macaques may carry herpes as well as hepatitis B. A particularly dirty shot came from the sanctuary&rsquo;s lawyer, Kevin Toyne, who told the court there are concerns things have gone wrong with Darwin while in Ms. Nakhuda&rsquo;s custody and &ldquo;it would not be appropriate to leave the two of them alone.&rdquo; This is typical of the protection racket run by those abysmal creatures promulgating and enforcing regulations. In the name of defending the victim&mdash;in this case Darwin&mdash;the sanctuary&rsquo;s lawyer presents a seedy insinuation hoping for an investigation&mdash;essentially pure harassment. Story Book Farm now stipulates that Yasmin be searched on any visit to Darwin, accompanied by a police escort and prohibited from touching her pet. </p>
    
    <p> The sanctuary put up a blog posting from Darwin: &ldquo;I am so happy to finally be able to live and act like a real monkey!&rdquo; he says, although a further posting, &ldquo;I would also love to be able to play with toys and other enrichment items,&rdquo; is not entirely compatible with that. Monkeys do not ask for &ldquo;enrichment items.&rdquo; Actually, no one does except OISE graduates and social workers. Nor is life behind bars in a cage any more like the home of a &ldquo;real monkey&rdquo; than Yasmin Nakhuda&rsquo;s dwelling with her one-on-one attention and day trips for Darwin. </p>
    
    <p>Darwin has been in touch with me too. He is utterly confused. Having been with humans since age six weeks, he has no idea what people are talking about, forcing him to &ldquo;live like a real monkey.&rdquo; Where are the bed linens and dining room table? He&rsquo;s heard about the herpes virus and worries that it might ruin any chance of bonding with a lady rhesus&mdash;should that ever be available. When is he supposed to warn her of his possible condition? Do they take tests together? Nor is he getting a warm reception from the other macaques who, hearing of Toyne&rsquo;s &ldquo;concerns,&rdquo; think Darwin may be a bit of a male ho. </p>
    
    <p>Obviously a free community has the right to determine what fauna it wants within its borders. On the principle that adult rate-payers are human beings who can govern their own affairs, restrictions should be limited to ones necessary for the safety, comfort and enjoyment of all. I can&rsquo;t fault a city that doesn&rsquo;t want to chance anacondas and tigers as pets although the famous painter Endre Szasz who lived in Toronto in the early seventies kept an ocelot in Rosedale and the late &ldquo;Baron&rdquo; Von Heczey had a couple of cheetahs in his Toronto Annex home. Heczey was a six-foot-three, 250-lb. wrestler. Probably anyone smaller should not have wild cats.  </p>
    
    <p>Tiny monkey Darwin was at large, indicating a lapse on the part of his owner. Okay, fine her, move her (she&rsquo;s just rented in animal-tolerant Kawartha Lakes, Ont., though newspapers claim a rush to pass laws there against exotic pets). But straightforward confiscation is crossing a double yellow line&mdash;made more despicable by sophistry claiming Darwin to be a wild beast and therefore the &ldquo;property&rdquo; of whoever has possession. I&rsquo;d give Ms. Nakhuda one more chance.  </p>
    
    <p>Ms. Nakhuda&rsquo;s desire for a pet monkey seems barmy but craziness is a human right provided no one is endangered or harmed. If we could devise sufficient tests for animals we&rsquo;d likely find their mental function and intelligence higher than we know and consequently our own behaviour often cruder. Taking Darwin from the only mother he has known because of a bylaw is inflexible and cruel, the hallmark of a society that has lost its bearings, just like Darwin. His excuse is being only seven months old. What&rsquo;s ours? </p>

    <hedline>On being home-schooled by &lsquo;chess parents,&rsquo; beating Kasparov and female competitors</hedline>

    <p> Judit Polg&aacute;r is the best-ranked<em> female chess player in history. Born in Hungary in 1976, she earned grandmaster status when she was 15. She has played, and bested, the likes of Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. She is now the only woman on the World Chess Federation&rsquo;s top 100 players list. Maclean&rsquo;s caught up with Polg&aacute;r in London, where she was playing in the London Chess Classic. </em></p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Are you nervous?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>It&rsquo;s not about being nervous. It&rsquo;s about preparation.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: How do you prepare? Do you have a morning ritual before competitions?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> Well, I wake up around 9:30 or 10 a.m. Then I go to the gym and have some breakfast. But then I&rsquo;m preparing for my specific opponent. I study how he plays, his repertoire. You see, in chess we have styles&mdash;like in any other field. There are also fashions in the kinds of systems that people play. So I&rsquo;m trying to know my opponent as much as possible.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em> <em>Are you superstitious? Do you need to eat the same breakfast every day before playing?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>No, not really. I had some superstitions when I was little. And a winning pen is always a good thing to have.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em> <em>You&rsquo;re often described as an aggressive player. Much has been written about your &ldquo;piercing eyes,&rdquo; and the way you stare down opponents. Is that accurate?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>I started playing chess when I was five years old. I learned the moves from my mother, then worked with my father&mdash;and later trainers. My style became very technical. I sacrificed a lot of things. I was always hunting for the king, for the mate. I&rsquo;d forget about my other pieces. Until a point it worked, and I won games that way. But later, when I started to play against the top-level grandmasters, there were times when I burned myself. And then I had to switch my style. But generally, I&rsquo;m still an attacking player.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: These competitions must be old hat to you; you&rsquo;ve been playing chess since the early</em>&rsquo;<em>80s. Is the game still exciting?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Well, the game is changing. Especially in the last decade or so. In the old days, I would bring my notes travelling with me. I&rsquo;d have 15 or 20 kg of notes. I had chess magazines and books&mdash;and I&rsquo;d have to write down and memorize everything. Now, we all have laptops and computer databases.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Does it feel different to play these days?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> Before, we were using our minds and creating by ourselves. But for the last 15 years, we&rsquo;ve been using analyzing engines. Every single person in the profession has an engine as a helper now. The engines contain six or seven million games, searchable by opening move, player, country, time control. That makes it possible to really research your opponent. Engines also calculate better and they don&rsquo;t make big blunders. So big blunders are completely avoided. People have more self-confidence now, because they have an engine to rely on. The engines also give ideas. Because of that, the game has changed a lot. Chess still has its creativity, but it&rsquo;s different. We have creativity to give guidelines to the engines on where to look for new ideas.</p>
    
    <p>The last few years have been tricky. There are three or four or five different engines to train with, and each evaluates situations in different ways. So if you know that somebody is working with this or that engine, you can say: &ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;ll probably go more technical.&rdquo; So the preparations are on a really advanced level. That said, if you just rely on the engine, you might end up in a situation where, say, you prepare up to move 22&mdash;and then at move 23 you look down at the board and you don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Are you nostalgic for the old days? You grew up playing against your father.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>For some years I struggled to accept that I had to use engines and computers so much. Because one of the things I liked most about chess was the creativity&mdash;the chance to be original and unexpected, which is more difficult nowadays. But it&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Do you have a photographic memory?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Definitely. I do. </p>
    
    <p><em>Q: A lot has been written about your childhood, and the way you learned chess. Can you talk about when you started playing?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>I was five years old. I have two older sisters and they were already playing. I just wanted to do the same thing.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Your sisters became professional chess masters. Were you competitive growing up?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Actually, we were never really competitive. We had a very special education, since we were all home-schooled. In Hungary in the 1980s, the Hungarian Federation was not very supportive of this. We had a lot of enemies. But we were very close with each other.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: You were home-schooled so that you could focus more on chess?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Yes. Actually, before he even met my mom, my father developed this idea that his children would not go to school. He wanted six children. And he wanted them to focus on one specific field. Well, after three children he stopped, but he still carried out the plan.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Why did your father pick chess?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>When Susan, the eldest of us, was 3&frac12;, she was already pretty good at chess and mathematics. My parents thought that it was better to focus on one field. They chose chess.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em> In Canada, we talk about &ldquo;hockey parents&rdquo; relentlessly driving their children to succeed. I guess &ldquo;chess parents&rdquo; are the intellectual equivalent. Did your father push you hard?</p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>My parents are extremely good pedagogues. They&rsquo;re both teachers. So they knew exactly how to treat a child to make her motivated and happy. Chess was natural for me; I was extremely successful. In the mid-&rsquo;80s my parents gave up their jobs so they could coordinate our training and travelling.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em> I read that your home-schooling involved learning Esperanto.</p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Yes, we all learned it. I don&rsquo;t speak it anymore. I didn&rsquo;t practise enough. But Esperanto gave a lot to my family. We were very poor. Through Esperanto, my parents found friends. There were occasions when we went to a tournament, and people in the Esperanto community would give us a place to stay. </p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em> <em>Your father&rsquo;s theory is that geniuses are made. Do you agree?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> Generally, I agree. But talent helps.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em>Part of your father&rsquo;s thinking was that his daughters should not play in women&rsquo;s leagues. You&rsquo;ve actually never competed in the Women&rsquo;s World Championship. Why?</p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Growing up, there was only ever one chess. Today, professional chess has an &ldquo;open&rdquo; section and a &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; section. And I always liked challenges. I was the No. 1-ranked woman since 1989. So I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to compete in women&rsquo;s leagues. It never felt challenging enough.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em>It seems strange that men and women compete separately at all in chess, since it&rsquo;s an intellectual sport. </p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>It&rsquo;s very hard to change traditions. If most women are supportive of it, then why not? They can be world champions and play in world cups.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: So you&rsquo;re saying that women like having a separate league because it&rsquo;s easier that way?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>Well, yeah. And actually, I can&rsquo;t blame them. I understand that&mdash;even though the women&rsquo;s league is absolutely not the same level. It&rsquo;s different, say, to beat the No. 1-ranked player, Magnus [Carlsen]&mdash;which I just did at a game in Mexico. But a win is a win, right? I think women know that if women&rsquo;s chess were abolished, then suddenly they would be nowhere in the world.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Is there something biological about it? Are women less capable in chess?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>No, no. It has nothing to do with that. It&rsquo;s society. Less than five per cent of registered chess players are women. When kids start playing chess&mdash;up to 10 or 12 years old&mdash;girls and boys are enrolled in equal numbers. Later on, it deviates a lot. The girls drop out.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em>You famously beat former No. 1-ranked player Garry Kasparov in a match in 2002. Kasparov was long skeptical of female players&mdash;and once said that the &ldquo;imperfections of the feminine psyche&rdquo; would prevent a woman from dominating on the chessboard. You must have felt vindicated when you won.</p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>(laughs) Well, Kasparov wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Did he apologize?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> I think there are some people who never apologize. But later he accepted me, by talking with me as another serious chess player. I later trained with him.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: You have two children now. How has that changed your career?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em>I&rsquo;m still playing chess, but I do too many other things to be competing at the highest level. I organize a chess festival in Hungary. I support chess in schools, and I have my own chess foundation. And I started writing books.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q: Has your sense of competition dulled?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> To lose is miserable. It&rsquo;s a bad feeling. You can&rsquo;t get used to it.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em>Are your children playing chess? </p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> Yes. My daughter is 6. My son is 8.</p>
    
    <p><em>Q:</em>Will they be professional players?</p>
    
    <p><em>A:</em> I don&rsquo;t think so. But I&rsquo;m happy that they play because I do believe that chess is good for children.</p>

     <hedline>99 stupid things  the government did with your money</hedline>
    
    <abstract>Luxury hotels, hemp body cream, and subsidized hip-hop concerts&mdash;our second-annual list of waste shows spending by all levels of government is still out of control</abstract>

  <p>For taxpayers concerned with out-of-control government spending, 2012 started on a bright enough note. Last January, the Department of National Defence announced it wanted to buy 20,000 custom-printed stress balls for its staff. Once Defence Minister Peter MacKay caught wind of the plan, he quickly cancelled the contract, calling it an &ldquo;unnecessary expense of taxpayer money.&rdquo;  Noble words, but it was a brief reprieve. As Maclean&rsquo;s found once again when researching this project, whether it was Ottawa, the provinces, municipalities or the organizations they oversee, governments couldn&rsquo;t help themselves when it came to doling out cash. What follows is but a fraction of the foolish, wasteful and blatantly stupid ways governments found to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money.  To uncover this year&rsquo;s 99 items we pored over press releases and auditor generals&rsquo; reports, sifted through proactive disclosure statements and delved into media databases across the country, ferreting out examples of spending that occurred in 2012 or came to light last year.  There will be those who take issue with some items on this list, arguing, for instance, that funding rock concerts boosts the economy. But the reality is that at every level of government, we&rsquo;re in far worse fiscal shape than we were even a year ago, despite all the talk of cutbacks and austerity. And as this list makes clear, those who control the public purse have yet to really change their ways.</p>
  
 
    <p>Sports &amp; Leisure &mdash; when blowing money is the name of the game </p>
    
    <p>1  <em>Bad slice:</em> The City of Abbotsford, B.C. handed a $115,000 &ldquo;one-time grant&rdquo; to a struggling municipal golf course, claiming its problems stem, in part, from poor weather. In a report, city staff said &ldquo;good weather&rdquo; was among the things &ldquo;being worked on&rdquo; to turn it around. </p>
    
    <p>2  <em>Sore loser:</em> Former Regina mayor Pat Fiacco expensed more than $4,000 worth of tickets to sporting events, including $1,055 for Montreal Alouettes season&rsquo;s tickets, nearly 3,000 km away. The tickets were the result of a bet Fiacco made with former Montreal mayor G&eacute;rald Tremblay that the Saskatchewan Roughriders would beat the Alouettes in the 2010 Grey Cup. The Riders lost&mdash;and so did Regina taxpayers.</p>
    
    <p>3  <em>Cheap seats:</em> Sam Katz, mayor of Winnipeg, is a big fan of the Blue Bombers, but apparently not enough to pay for tickets out of his own pocket. The mayor billed taxpayers $2,033 for a pair of season&rsquo;s tickets, even though critics pointed out that other politicians, like Premier Greg Selinger, paid for their own sporting tickets.</p>
    
    <p>4  <em>Losing bet:</em> Vancouver Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo clearly knows when to hold &rsquo;em and fold &rsquo;em. The B.C. Lottery Corp. paid him $160,000 last year for an endorsement deal that included a $10,000 entry fee into the World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas&mdash;pocket change for a man with a decade left on a $64-million hockey contract.</p>
    
    <p>5  <em>Le&rsquo;go the money:</em> Ontario&rsquo;s Municipal Property Assessment Corp. spent $170,000 on a one-day team-building event that included an exercise playing with Lego.</p>
    
    <p>6  <em>Out of bounds:</em> The City of Whitehorse coughed up $1.3 million for Mount Sima, a struggling nearby ski hill. The money was diverted from the city&rsquo;s infrastructure fund, which had been topped up by the federal government. That was on top of $1.6 million the city gave the hill a year earlier for a ski lift. </p>
    
  
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Ottawa shovelled $1.5 million into 10 Quebec snowmobile clubs for snow grooming (7); the feds pumped $13,000 into a Tsawwassen lawn bowling club in Delta, B.C., to create &ldquo;jobs, growth and long-term economic prosperity&rdquo; (8); the City of Ottawa spent $48,000 on a &ldquo;deluxe&rdquo; three-sided bike cage for city employees (9); Saanich, B.C., faces an $818,000 deficit on the city-owned Cedar Hill golf course (10); Kitchener, Ont., transferred $1 million into a &ldquo;golf stabilization reserve fund&rdquo; to prop up two money-losing golf courses (11).</p>
    
    
    <p>Other folks&rsquo; money &mdash; corporate handouts and subsidies for all  </p>
    
    <p>12  <em>Korppor&auml;t welf&aring;r:</em> Ikea is a Swedish retailing behemoth rolling in kronor, but when it came to opening its first store in Winnipeg, that didn&rsquo;t stop the city and province from offering a combined $22 million in subsidies. Did we mention Ikea&rsquo;s annual sales of $30 billion are roughly three times what Manitoba brings in each year from all forms of taxes, fees and transfers?</p>
    
    <p>13 <em>Paper chase:</em> In December 2011, Nova Scotia&rsquo;s provincial government handed $24 million to the owner of the Bowater Mersey paper mill in return for a swath of company land in the hopes of staving off its closure. By June the mill had gone out of business. </p>
    
    <p>14 <em>Something fishy:</em> For more than a decade, Supreme Sturgeon and Caviar of New Brunswick raked in some $3 million in grants and loans from the federal government before falling into receivership in 2010. Resurrected by new owners as Breviro Caviar, it&rsquo;s now back in the subsidy business, winning $200,000 from Ottawa in marketing funds and $50,000 to &ldquo;hire expertise in caviar production.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>15 <em>Flat battery:</em> The B.C. government said it would spend $2.7 million to build hundreds of electric-car-charging stations across the province in an effort to encourage drivers to buy vehicles such as the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf. That&rsquo;s in addition to a $5,000 rebate to drivers. Yet just 210 electric vehicles have been sold in the province&mdash;effectively translating into an $18,000 per vehicle subsidy for the carmakers.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Four months after getting $3.8 million from New Brunswick to create 300 new jobs, Radian6, a social media monitoring firm, said it would slash 100 jobs globally (16); a CBC News analysis found $20 million doled out by Newfoundland to attract out-of-province business generated just 58 full-time jobs (17).</p>
    

<p>Cultured club &mdash; the same old song and dance for taxpayers</p>

  <p>18 <em>TV time:</em> British Columbians saw $48,000 go to bringing <em>Entertainment Tonight Canada</em> to Vancouver for three days. Included in the provincial payout was $16,000 in airfare from Toronto and $12,000 worth of hotel accommodations.</p>
    
    <p>19  <em>Tear down the haul:</em> The federal government subsidized Quebec City&rsquo;s summer festival to the tune of $1 million, in part to help pay for a show by former Pink Floyd band member Roger Waters. The Plains of Abraham was the last stop on the aging rocker&rsquo;s Wall Tour, which earned a total of $158 million from worldwide ticket sales. </p>
    
    <p>20  <em>Party on:</em> The B.C. government sponsored a $3-million rock music tour last summer called JobFest, where attendees (when there were any) were offered on-site career counselling. Roughly $100,000 went to promotional kits, including glow sticks, guitar picks and glossy posters, mailed out to local businesses and media. </p>
    
    <p>21 <em>Moving pictures:</em> Winnipeg city council voted to spend $10,000 to transfer a work of art from the old Winnipeg airport to the University of Manitoba, even though city staff recommended denying the request.</p>
    
    <p>22  <em>Stamped out:</em> 2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the Calgary Stampede, and though it bills itself as the &ldquo;Greatest Show on Earth,&rdquo; the federal government still felt the need to kick in $5 million to promote it&mdash;including putting a chuckwagon food truck in New York City. </p>
    
    <p>23  <em>A black eye:</em> In May, Halifax councillors voted to cut a cheque for $360,000 to cover bad debts stemming from a money-losing Black Eyed Peas concert two years earlier.</p>
    
    <p>Showing off &mdash; The price of looking good is on the rise </p>
    
    <p>24  <em>Maybe he&rsquo;s born with it:</em> Not one to be caught without his game face on, it was revealed the office of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty expensed $130 worth of cosmetics for an apparent beauty emergency ahead of a televised budget announcement. Flaherty&rsquo;s staff scrambled to purchase concealer, blush, loose powder and shaving supplies to do the minister&rsquo;s makeup after a cosmetician cancelled at the last minute. For anyone wanting to replicate the look, Flaherty wears a combination of Maybelline, CoverGirl and Smashbox. </p>
    
    <p>25 <em>Funny money:</em> The Bank of Canada spent nearly $40,000 to promote its new $20 bill. The spending included $35,832 to a company to design and install seven-storey images of the new polymer note on the bank&rsquo;s headquarters in downtown Ottawa in May. In total, spending to promote the new bill equalled 1,942 of the new $20 notes.</p>
    
    <p>26  <em>Fumble for fame:</em> Four small cities, including Guelph, Ont., and Langley, B.C., forked over a total of roughly $100,000 to have former football great Terry Bradshaw appear in short promos about them that were meant to attract new American business to small-town Canada. The videos found airtime mostly off hours, while the famous QB, who narrates the promos, couldn&rsquo;t sound more bored. </p>
    
    <p>27  <em>Over-planned:</em> The recession may have ended a while ago, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Stephen Harper&rsquo;s government from spending millions on advertisements featuring its Economic Action Plan stimulus slogan. The government spent $16 million in three months on feel-good commercials about Canada&rsquo;s economic prosperity.</p>
    
    <p>28 <em>Top gun:</em> Despite getting a mock jet for free from manufacturer Lockheed Martin, Defence Minister Peter MacKay still managed to spend $47,000 on a 2010 press conference where he posed with the fake plane.</p>
    
    <p>29  <em>Centless spending:</em> Eliminating the penny was supposed to save the government, but not without a final splurge. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty stamped the last Canadian penny in a photo op that cost $56,000.</p>
    
    <p>30  <em>Gold medal waste:</em> The federal government spent at least $4.5 million on ads that ran during the two weeks of the London Olympics, but shelled out just $214,000 to Canadian athletes who won medals during the Games.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Jason Kenney&rsquo;s department spent almost $750,000 monitoring what ethnic media were saying about the immigration minister and his ministry while denying the exercise was politically motivated (31); B.C. Premier Christy Clark&rsquo;s office spent $64 million on ad campaigns, twice that of her predecessor (32); the City of Ottawa spent $3,500 on a consultant to teach firefighters how to talk to the media, despite having a communications staff of 44, many of whom were capable of doing it themselves (33); the Town of Innisfil, Ont., spent four years and $42,000 on outside consultants to design a new logo, even though a local graphic designer offered them a logo she designed for free (34).</p>
    
    <p>See the world &mdash; So long as it&rsquo;s on the  taxpayer&rsquo;s dime </p>
    
    <p>35  <em>Down under:</em> Claude Benoit, CEO for the Old Port of Montreal, billed taxpayers $10,100 for a 29-day trip she took with a friend to Australia and New Zealand, claiming she was working for part of the trip. In 2012 the federal government asked the auditor general to probe Benoit&rsquo;s spending after a series of unusual bills, including $7,100 for trips to Sweden and Florida and $38,000 for catered meals to the port offices.</p>
    
    <p>36  <em>Vacant splendour:</em> Alberta spent nearly $114,000 on more than a dozen unoccupied rooms at a five-star hotel in London during the Summer Olympic Games. The province had planned to send 47 people to London to promote Alberta tourism, but scaled back, leaving the rooms at the $850-a-night Le Meridien Piccadilly empty.</p>
    
    <p>37  <em>Working holiday:</em> Councillors in Central Saanich, B.C., didn&rsquo;t think to check on their colleague Terry Siklenka after giving him a six-month paid leave of absence worth $6,000. If they had, they would have learned he was still hard at work&mdash;having taken a job on the side in the Cayman Islands. Only after a media uproar ensued was Siklenka forced to resign.</p>
    
    <p>38  <em>Fumble for fame:</em> B.C.&rsquo;s Liberal Speaker, Bill Barisoff, his deputy, NDP Claire Trevena, and a clerk billed taxpayers to take their spouses on a junket to Africa, with at least one couple travelling business class at a cost of $7,000 each.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Alberta&rsquo;s Conservative government dropped $70,000 on a caucus retreat to the luxurious Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge to brainstorm how to trim the province&rsquo;s $3-billion deficit.(39); Minister of National Revenue Gail Shea and a staffer spent $2,400 to attend a &ldquo;Tax Savings Day&rdquo; event in Toronto to promote a previously announced small-business tax credit (40); Statistics Canada had to cover a $4,000 bill for damage caused to a hotel room by a census enumerator (41); three federal departments spent more than $50,000 sending diplomats and bureaucrats to London to learn how to promote the oil sands (42); the Quebec government spent $200,000 for a bash in Paris to celebrate the province&rsquo;s 50th anniversary of having a delegation in that city (43).</p>
    
    <p>Reports of wasted spending &mdash; are in no way exaggerated </p>
    
    <p>44  <em>Hi and dry:</em> Quebec uncovered yet another threat to the French language in that province&mdash;the rising scourge of the word &ldquo;hi.&rdquo; Quebec&rsquo;s language police hired a research firm at a cost of $150,000 to dispatch observers into 400 retailers in downtown Montreal in search of language infractions. The report noted a dangerous increase in the use of &ldquo;<em>bonjour</em>, hi,&rdquo; from one per cent of salutations two years ago, to 13 per cent. </p>
    
    <p>45  <em>Public lard-caster:</em> The CBC spent $56,000 to survey its own employees in a sole-sourced contract with Phoenix Strategic Partnership. Surprise, surprise: 80 per cent had a positive impression of the CBC and 70 per cent said the public broadcaster succeeded at &ldquo;enriching democratic life.&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>46 <em>Jet lagged:</em> After dissing reports from the auditor general and Parliamentary Budget Office that warned the price of F-35 fighter jets would be far higher than the $16 billion the Harper government promised, the feds shelled out $645,000 for an outside opinion. After paying KPMG to review the defence department numbers, the government finally accepted the price would be $45 billion.</p>
    
    <p>47  <em>Scooped:</em> When the <em>Guelph Mercury</em> reported complaints from two councillors about city staff in the Ontario town, other councillors voted to have the city&rsquo;s integrity commissioner look into the matter. Three months and $10,500 later, lawyer Robert Swayze submitted his report, stating any violation was inadvertent, prompting one councillor who voted for the investigation to declare it a &ldquo;complete waste.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> A year after the city hired an outside firm to complete an efficiency review of the Toronto Police Service at a cost of $249,965, the police services board put out a tender looking for a consulting firm to look for &ldquo;delayering&rdquo; opportunities at a cost of $299,000 (48); a $127,000 report Saskatchewan Health had commissioned from Ornge, Ontario&rsquo;s troubled air ambulance service, turned out to be ghostwritten by a new M.B.A. grad with no industry experience (49).</p>
    
    <p>Food and entertainment &mdash; Living it up on government money</p>
    
      <p>50  <em>Out of juice:</em> Bev Oda proved a glass of juice can end a political career. But the former minister of international co-operation&rsquo;s taxpayer-funded OJ, which famously cost $16, was only the tastiest of her luxuries. Oda also expensed a $1,000-a-day limo service and a $665-a-night stay at the Savoy hotel in London, only paying the money back after she was exposed. </p>
    
    <p>51  <em>A real hoot:</em> The B.C. ministry of forests plunked down $375 over three separate visits to a Hooters restaurant in Edmonton. </p>
    
    <p>52  <em>Gift wrapped:</em> In an effort to boost morale, the B.C. government has a $1.5-million program called the &ldquo;recognition cupboard&rdquo; that encourages employees to select from a wide variety of gifts, all paid for by the government, to give to their co-workers. Among the items employees can give each other on the public dime: Starbucks gift cards, CamelBak water bottles and Mountain Equipment Co-op backpacks.</p>
    
    <p>53  <em>Unhealthy spending:</em> Allaudin Merali, a former CFO with Alberta Health Services, expensed taxpayers for more than $346,000&mdash;including $900 spent at a wine store. Merali also expensed $1,750 for repairs to his Mercedes and $2,300 for a new car phone. His punishment? No severance package.</p>
    
    <p>54  <em>Safety Wiener:</em> Agriculture Canada handed $826,000 to Brampton, Ont.&rsquo;s Cardinal Meat Specialists Ltd. to help the meat-processing company research a sausage that doesn&rsquo;t burst open when cooked. In a news release, Pierre Lemieux, the parliamentary secretary for agriculture, said a grant to develop a less-explosive sausage was critical to the government&rsquo;s focus on &ldquo;jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Six months before Alberta&rsquo;s XL Foods was shut down because of a massive recall of <em>E. coli</em>-tainted meat, the company got a $1.3-million contribution from Ottawa to upgrade its meat-processing facilities (55); The Canada Food Inspection Agency spent $19,900 to ask 1,200 Canadians how to label bottles containing blends of both Canadian and foreign wine&mdash;most said &ldquo;Blended in Canada&rdquo; (56); Alberta Premier Alison Redford&rsquo;s sister, Lynn Redford, a health care executive, expensed $3,400 for attending partisan functions (57); Quebec&rsquo;s state liquor authority, SAQ, paid $24,000 to wine critic James Suckling of Tuscany so he would visit Montreal and review 30 wines, all while denying it gave him any compensation (58).</p>
    
    <p>Weather and Environment &mdash; the forecast is for lots of spending </p>
    
    <p>59  <em>Calm down:</em> The City of Waterloo said it plans to spend as much as $90,000 studying whether to erect a wind turbine, despite a 2011 report that showed the city wasn&rsquo;t windy enough to make the project financially feasible. Regardless of those findings, the federal government gave the city another $63,000 to keep studying its wind turbine project.</p>
    
    <p>60  <em>Walk the talk:</em> In Winnipeg, after a councillor slipped on ice and broke his hip, the city spent $5,000 to help set up a website called <em>Surefoot.org</em> that gives a single general overview of &ldquo;winter-related walking conditions&rdquo; for the entire city, from &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to &ldquo;hazardous.&rdquo; The risk recently: &ldquo;moderate.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>61 <em>Out of credit:</em> The B.C. Pacific Carbon Trust was set up in 2008 to buy and sell carbon credits with the aim of reducing carbon emissions, but critics say it has mostly served to transfer taxpayer money from schools and hospitals to corporations. Over a year virtually all $14-million worth of credits were purchased by school boards, health authorities and other public agencies. Businesses bought just $54,050 worth. Yet as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation noted, huge companies like Encana, Canfor and Lafarge received an estimated $3 million by reducing carbon emissions and selling credits to the trust.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> The City of Whitehorse and the feds spent $258,000 to figure out a waste-to-energy facility wasn&rsquo;t economically viable (62); Toronto shelled out $274, 000 to renovate Ted Reeve Community Arena, claiming the retrofits would pay for themselves, when an audit found no energy savings materialized and the arena board repaid just $51,000 of the upfront costs (63).</p>
    
    <p>Nice job &mdash; Working  for the taxpayer, that is </p>
    
    <p>64  <em>Home alone:</em> Senators who apparently live in the capital full-time are collecting thousands of dollars in living expenses meant to help with the costs of owning a second home in Ottawa. Over the past two years, Mike Duffy, a Conservative senator for P.E.I., has claimed $33,413, even though he spends most of his time at his Ottawa home. Likewise, Liberal Sen. Mac Harb, who has lived in Ottawa since the 1970s, has also received $31,237 while claiming his primary residence is in nearby Pembroke. </p>
    
    <p>65  <em>'Cause it hurts:</em> In February, TTC commissioners loyal to Toronto Mayor Rob Ford voted to fire the transit system&rsquo;s general manager Gary Webster &ldquo;without cause.&rdquo; The move triggered two years of severance payments totalling more than $500,000, costing the TTC more than if Webster&rsquo;s contract had been allowed to expire. </p>
    
    <p>66  <em>Book worm:</em> Barry Holmes, the former CEO of the Greater Victoria Public Library, expensed $132,000 on his corporate credit card over 3&frac12; years, including music downloads and $500 for hemp-based body cream. After leaving his job in Victoria, he took a similar position in Windsor, Ont., where, according to reports, he racked up another $67,000 in credit card charges, including $2,000 for antiques, before quitting.</p>
    
    <p>67  <em>Ghost committee:</em> Twenty-one Alberta MLAs were each paid at least $1,000 a month to sit on a committee that hadn&rsquo;t met since 2008. Some MLAs claimed they didn&rsquo;t know they were collecting for being on the standing committee on privileges and elections, standing orders and printing. Taxpayers scoffed at the $261,000 annual total, and Alberta suspended the payments in March.</p>
    
    <p>68  <em>Double dipping:</em> An audit uncovered an unnamed retired public servant, who, while collecting a pension, landed $170,000 worth of training contracts from the Canada School of Public Service. Incidentally, among the school&rsquo;s courses, one teaches values and ethics when managing public funds.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Joe Fontana, the beleaguered mayor of London, faces fraud and breach of trust charges after allegedly using $20,000 of government money in 2005 to pay for his son&rsquo;s wedding (69); a public service watchdog revealed an unnamed bureaucrat at Human Resources and Skills Development expensed massage chairs plus flat-screen TVs for her home, while hiring a &ldquo;close relative&rdquo; who collected excessive overtime pay (70); a House of Commons committee found former Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois leader Gilles Duceppe used &ldquo;many thousands of dollars&rdquo; to pay a partisan political staffer (71); B.C. Premier Christy Clark paid a $67,000 severance to a press secretary after just 11 months on the job (72); a development company owned by the Mushuau and Sheshatshiu Innu communities in Newfoundland paid its CEO Paul Rich more than $1 million in just two years (73); a Treasury Board report revealed federal employees are calling in sick an average of 18 days a year, roughly 2&frac12; times the absentee rate in the private sector, which costs taxpayers more than $1 billion a year (74); dozens of federal Conservative staffers have failed to keep up with their credit card payments, with the industry minister&rsquo;s office alone racking up $4,000 in delinquent fees (75); after barely two years on the job at Alberta Health Services as an executive, Allison Tonge, an import from Britain, was let go with a severance package of 12 monthly payments of $35,000 plus $15,000 in relocation expenses for her return to the United Kingdom (76).</p>
    
    <p>On second thought &mdash; a change of plans doesn&rsquo;t come cheap </p>
    
    <p>77  <em>Read and weep:</em> Calgary Transit spent about $500,000 preparing for the launch of a new electronic payment system, only to cancel its contract with the supplier in November. Some of the card readers had already been installed on buses and at LRT stations and had to be removed. </p>
    
    <p>78  <em>Registered complaint:</em> After the Ontario Ministry of Health scrapped a project to develop an electronic registry of diabetes payments, claiming there were no cancellation costs, an audit found the ministry actually spent $24 million on the defunct project. </p>
    
    <p>79  <em>Timber tussle:</em> The City of Ottawa has spent $853,000 in legal fees and settlement payments to block six homeowners from chopping down city trees that were growing into their houses, only to backtrack and agree to cut down trees causing &ldquo;serious damage&rdquo; to private property. </p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Two years after spending $86,000 to install bike lanes on Jarvis Street in Toronto, the city spent $272,000 to remove them after complaints from the mayor (80); Industry Canada spent three years and $1.4 million on an online calculator for people to compare cellphone rates, only to scrap it after lobbying from the telecommunications industry (81); the District of Lillooet, B.C., had to spend $5,000 to hold a by-election after the mayor and a councillor quit after one month on the job (82).</p>
    
    <p>Infrastructure &mdash; building a better way to spend your money</p>
    
      <p>83  <em>Wheels of fortune:</em> Rather than purchase a new truck for its fleet, when public works manager Dan Brazier&rsquo;s 17-year-old pick-up broke down in February 2011, the City of Colwood, B.C., spent $1,000 a month to rent one while it worked on developing an equipment replacement strategy. By December, after it had racked up $10,000 in rental charges on a truck worth $30,000, the city finally decided it had better buy a vehicle.</p>
    
    <p>84  <em>Shut the door:</em> Taxpayers in Waterloo, Ont., forked out $173,000 in emergency funding to replace four fabric doors on a landfill garage after one of them blew off, just three years after the doors were installed. The door supplier said they were never built to withstand wind levels seen at the site and shouldn&rsquo;t have been used. </p>
    
    <p>85  <em>Dunce cap:</em> An investigation by the <em>Toronto Star</em>unearthed a host of questionable spending on maintenance work by the Toronto District School Board. Among the waste: $143 to install four screws into a $17 pencil sharpener; $3,000 and 76 hours to install an electrical outlet in a school library; $266 to hang three pictures (and another $857 to do it again eight days later); $164 for four workers to move a school bench; $810 to scrub graffiti from a bathroom wall and $2,670 to replace light bulbs in a school lunch room.</p>
    
    <p>86  <em>Nobody&rsquo;s home:</em> The federal government spent $1.5 million to maintain a massive 108,000-sq.-ft. warehouse known as Plouffe Park in Ottawa, which is set to be torn down next year. It has poured another $5.5 million into the former headquarters of Agriculture Canada, though the building has sat empty since 2009.</p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> Vancouver&rsquo;s Translink transit authority paid $500,000 for just 13 TV screens installed in Skytrain stations in 2009; many of them no longer work (87); Transport Qu&eacute;bec spent $2.2 million on a paving project but left a utility pole in the middle of the road, forcing them to redo that stretch at further expense (88); Quebec taxpayers are paying $700,000 a year for rented office space in Tokyo to house provincial diplomats in Japan rather than use the Canadian embassy (89); Regina&rsquo;s Prairie Valley School Division paid $2,400 for two office chairs even as it campaigned against cuts to its education budget (90); a property line dispute near Sudbury, Ont,, between Richard Majkot and the city has, over the last five years, cost taxpayers $500,000 (91); Ontario taxpayers have yet to see the final bill for two power plant projects Dalton McGuinty&rsquo;s government cancelled just days before the 2011 election, but it&rsquo;s at least $230 million and could top $1 billion (92); an audit of Ontario&rsquo;s scandal-plagued air ambulance service Ornge found the government-funded agency is paying 40 per cent above fair market value to lease its headquarters from its own subsidiary, which has already meant $2 million in overpayments during the first five years of the 25-year lease (93).</p>
    
    <p>Law and disorder &mdash; Keeping the peace keeps costing more money </p>
    
    <p>94  <em>Hat trick:</em> The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces spent $438,385 on government-branded sports memorabilia it claimed were crucial to recruiting and peacekeeping efforts. Over the past five years the departments have spent a staggering $176,000 on hockey pucks alone, with a DND spokesman saying it was crucial to promoting Canada&rsquo;s role &ldquo;in contributing to international peace and security.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>95  <em>Insecurity:</em> When it was announced former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush would swing through Surrey, B.C., in 2011 for a $600-a ticket debate, Mayor Dianne Watts insisted the event wouldn&rsquo;t cost taxpayers a penny. Instead, it cost $45,000 for RCMP to provide security. </p>
    
    <p>96  <em>Naked theft:</em> Ahead of the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, critics warned it was a bad idea to hold such a high-security event in the middle of downtown, and today the costs keep coming. Among the 144 businesses the government had to compensate: the Zanzibar Tavern strip club, which received $5,900 for lost income. </p>
    
    <p><em>Meanwhile:</em> The Ontario government spent $225,000 on bulletproof vests for provincial park wardens carrying out &ldquo;enforcement duties&rdquo; despite the fact no warden has ever been shot (97); the Abbotsford, B.C., police department spent &ldquo;under $1,000&rdquo; to mail Christmas cards to those on the city&rsquo;s naughty list, featuring a photo of the police chief as a heavily armed Santa Claus (98); the Canada Border Services Agency paid a Nanaimo shipyard company nearly $350,000 over two years to look after the MV Sun Sea, a rusty ship that had brought would-be refugees from Sri Lanka in 2010 (99).</p>

    <abstract>New British laws will allow a female heir to take  the throne. There&rsquo;s just one problem: the colonies.</abstract>

  <body.content>
    <p>Is there perhaps a silent prayer sweeping stealthily across the ranks of Canada&rsquo;s constitutional experts? &ldquo;Please, Lord, let the duchess of Cambridge be delivered of a fine, healthy heir. And if you could see to it, let it be a boy. Or, if it&rsquo;s a girl, make sure she only has younger sisters.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>When St. James&rsquo;s Palace announced on Dec. 3 that the wife of HRH Prince William was great with child, the machinery of the Commonwealth was ready. The heads of government in the Queen&rsquo;s various realms had, in October 2011, already agreed to a coordinated change in their statutes that will allow the Prince&rsquo;s children to succeed in order of seniority, irrespective of sex. The necessary changes to British law, which affect acts as far back as 1351, are ready for parliamentary approval and scheduled to go through as early as possible in the new year, with the Canadian ones to follow. There is nary a whisper of dissent from any quarter. </p>
    
    <p>But on Dec. 4, a couple of troublemakers&mdash;University of Ottawa professor Philippe Lagass&eacute; and graduate student James Bowden&mdash;took to the pages of the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em> to chirp a warning. Since 1931, Canada has had an independent throne that happens to be occupied by the same person who occupies the U.K.&rsquo;s. This is a fine point on which all monarchists agree; indeed, they get positively snippy when someone refers to our &ldquo;British&rdquo; sovereign. </p>
    
    <p>And it&rsquo;s universally recognized that Canada must separately ratify any change to the succession of Canada&rsquo;s throne. The U.K. no longer makes law for us. The Privy Council Office has announced specific plans to implement the change in federal Parliament, and the government has a promise of enthusiastic support from the New Democratic Opposition. </p>
    
    <p>But the Constitution Act of 1982 says that any amendment to Canada&rsquo;s Constitution &ldquo;in relation to the office of the Queen&rdquo; has to have the unanimous consent of the provincial legislatures as well as the Senate and the House of Commons. The natural meaning of the phrase &ldquo;office of the Queen,&rdquo; Bowden and Lagass&eacute; point out, would seem to include succession arrangements. (Their position has found support from the University of Sydney&rsquo;s Anne Twomey, who argues that the same problem exists in Australia with regard to its states.) Certainly the old U.K. laws now being amended have always been considered part of the Canadian Constitution. </p>
    
    <p>So do the provinces need to sign off on the trendy change in favour of gender equality? And could one province block it, either now or in the distant future? </p>
    
    <p>The Privy Council Office&rsquo;s view is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; PCO spokesman Raymond Rivet acknowledges that &ldquo;there are a lot of opinions being put forward about that,&rdquo; but says the official view is that &ldquo;there are no constitutional implications&rdquo; involved in the succession change. The Canadian legislation, says Rivet, merely &ldquo;signals Parliament&rsquo;s agreement&rdquo; to the changes being made in the U.K. </p>
    
    <p>As the Ottawa scholars note in the <em>Citizen</em>, there is pretty much just one piece of Canadian case law relevant to the issue: O&rsquo;Donohue v. Canada, a 2003 case from Ontario&rsquo;s Superior Court in which a Roman Catholic challenged the Act of Settlement of 1701 on the grounds that the exclusion of Catholics from the throne was discriminatory. Unfortunately, Justice Paul Rouleau did not exactly succeed in making the issue clearer. He confirmed that the royal succession rules are part of the Constitution: that&rsquo;s a point explicitly against the view the PCO is now trying to carry off. He also noted that the preamble to the old British North America Act of 1867 guarantees that we will have the same monarch as Great Britain&mdash;a &ldquo;symmetry&rdquo; that is &ldquo;axiomatic&rdquo; to our Constitution. </p>
    
    <p>Score one for the PCO. But at another point Rouleau appears to question the axiom; he suggests that if Canada had not ratified the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII&mdash;which it did&mdash;it might not have been in force here, raising the possibility that the Canada-U.K. personal union of thrones could be broken unless all the i&rsquo;s are dotted and the t&rsquo;s are crossed. After all, if the common identity of the sovereign is &ldquo;axiomatic,&rdquo; why was any action by Canada&rsquo;s Parliament necessary when Edward quit? </p>
    
    <p>The good news is that the current order of succession is all male (not counting the person at the top) through the life of 30-year-old Prince William. The oddball possibility of a vexatious provincial challenge to the succession arises if his wife has a baby girl first, followed at some point by a boy. Many subjects are probably hoping this will come about; there has been good luck with female monarchs since Mary I. But from the standpoint of the law, a boy would be . . . just . . . easier, okay?     </p>

  <body.content>
  
    <p>It has been 25 years since Trevor Greene gave up competitive rowing for other pursuits: journalism, travel, soldiering, fatherhood, marriage. But today, at age 48, sitting in a wheelchair in his Nanaimo, B.C., home, the forcibly retired army captain is rowing as hard as he&rsquo;s trained for any event in his life. </p>
    
    <p>Today he rows only in his mind, where he also visualizes walking. The frustrations are enormous for a man once thought of as invincible. He used to be part of the men&rsquo;s eight crew at King&rsquo;s College in Halifax, and at the elite club level, pulling until his muscles screamed and the callouses were thick on his hands. Now he makes perfect strokes with his mind, the neurons firing along a familiar course as he stirs up long-remembered sensations: the feel of oar in hand and boat in water. &ldquo;All that stuff: the sound and the heat and the pain,&rdquo; he says. When the oar enters the water, &ldquo;I imagine the tug on my shoulders, because it&rsquo;s a very good feeling. Very distinctive.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>To even have these cogent thoughts, let alone articulate them and work toward turning them to action, is near miraculous. This is a man who doctors once thought was doomed to an institution; a member of the living dead. His life of accomplishment and adventure was torn asunder with one violent stroke on March 4, 2006. A teen under the thrall of the Taliban saw a Canadian soldier, helmet off for a goodwill meeting with the elders of an Afghan village, and buried a homemade axe into Trevor&rsquo;s skull. </p>
    
    <p>Everything changed for Trevor that day. For all the days since, the stakes have been higher than anything he&rsquo;s faced in a life full of challenges. But as he confronts them, his brain is recovering in ways that rehabilitation specialists once thought impossible. Every three months for two years, researchers have looked into his brain with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine and charted an amazing pace of healing, years after the brief window of recovery considered the norm for a damaged brain closed. &ldquo;The reality is that, yes, the results have been spectacular,&rdquo; says neuroscientist Ryan D&rsquo;Arcy of the preliminary findings of the study. And the progress, which once seemed so impossibly elusive for a man with a profoundly damaged brain, is defying what were once the known limits of science, medicine and physiology. </p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s been four years since I visited Trevor, his wife, Debbie, and daughter, Grace, to write an article for <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em>. To see Trevor today is like walking into the midst of an unfolding miracle. His voice is stronger; his core strength and upper-body mobility have made a quantum leap. There is growing power in his lower limbs, and a sense of confidence, accomplishment and momentum&mdash;the swagger of a rower after a good day on the water. Some frustrating days he doesn&rsquo;t see this, Trevor admits, but his brain knows. And when he looks back, he realizes how far he has pulled himself along. </p>
    
    <p>Debbie breezes into the house, back from picking up groceries, a whirlwind of positive energy. Grace, born before Trevor&rsquo;s 2006 deployment to Afghanistan, is almost 8. Five months ago, Debbie gave birth to their son, Noah. In the interim, the couple wrote <em>March Forth</em>, the book title a play on the date of the attack, and the story an account of the six years since. Much of the detail of the &#64257;rst two years of recovery, of which Trevor has no memory, is drawn from Debbie&rsquo;s diaries. But Trevor, a former journalist with Bloomberg News, was the principal writer for much of the book. Days before my arrival, they learned it was long-listed for the Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction, which tells you all you need to know about his acuity. &ldquo;Trevor&rsquo;s mental abilities are extremely good,&rdquo; says D&rsquo;Arcy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly smarter than I am.&rdquo;</p>
    
 
    <p>It was in 2009 in Halifax when D&rsquo;Arcy saw a repeat of <em>Peace Warrior</em>, an award-winning documentary on the early stages of Trevor&rsquo;s recovery. There is a devastating moment in the documentary when Trevor is told by a doctor, assessing his fused ankles and non-responsive legs, that there is little chance he&rsquo;ll walk again. D&rsquo;Arcy, then working for the National Research Council&rsquo;s Institute for Biodiagnostics in Halifax, believed the legs weren&rsquo;t the fundamental problem. He remembers shouting at the TV: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the brain! It&rsquo;s in the brain!&rdquo; He tracked down the Greenes through Sue Ridout, the documentary&rsquo;s producer. &ldquo;I think I can help,&rdquo; he told them.</p>
    
    <p>D&rsquo;Arcy is a neuroscientist in the exploding fields of brain research and the non-invasive measure of brain activity through devices such as fMRI, which maps parts of the brain used for different activities by measuring increases in blood oxygenation and flow in affected areas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s humbling,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You learn not to make predictions because the field is growing so fast it would be dangerous to say that can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>A research project was born, one with the Greenes as partners in its design. Every three months, Debbie and Trevor drive down Vancouver Island to Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria, where the six-foot-four Trevor squeezes into an fMRI machine, an experience like being stuffed into a torpedo tube, he says. </p>
    
    <p>Trevor&rsquo;s brain at rest is charted and measured against a control subject, usually Stephen Lindsay, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Victoria and a partner in the research project. The Greenes helped set three priorities they wanted to track. One was the movement of hands to his mouth. (&ldquo;I want to drink beer again,&rdquo; Trevor said.) Mission accomplished. They also track leg movement because walking is his ultimate goal.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, in one of the most exciting elements of the study, Trevor suggested he visualize an activity while in the machine. They settled on rowing. D&rsquo;Arcy, a former rower himself, was intrigued by the possibilities. He&rsquo;s learned never to underestimate the brain&rsquo;s resilience. As the capacity to measure its activity grows, so does a new appreciation of its untapped potential. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s got 100 billion neurons,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Each of them has tens of thousands of connections that are modulated in all sorts of ways. You start to do the math on that, and you&rsquo;re moving past 10 to the 28th power of possible connection states. Anyone who conceives they would understand that is asking the wrong question.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Certainly, the results for Trevor have surpassed D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s expectations. With each scan, his brain activation increased, preceding improvements months later in his motor function, the area of the brain most affected by the axe blow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing the calculations now,&rdquo; says D&rsquo;Arcy, who has since moved to B.C. to take twin appointments, a professorship and chair in medical technologies at Simon Fraser University and the helm of health sciences and innovation at Surrey Memorial Hospital. &ldquo;At last count, it was over a 6&frac12;-fold [increase in lower-body brain activation] from time one to time eight.&rdquo; Reading the scans proved a powerful motivation for both Trevor and Debbie, who assists in his gruelling daily 2&frac12;-hour rehabilitation routines. </p>
    
    <p>During the first two sessions, Trevor needed a lift to move from his wheelchair to the bed for the fMRI scans. By the third time, he stunned the researchers by getting out of the chair with only Debbie&rsquo;s help. By the eighth time, Trevor got out of the chair by himself. By the 10th time, he used his hip-flexor muscles to move his legs. &ldquo;In the two years since I met him,&rdquo; says Lindsay, &ldquo;during a time when neurology texts would have predicted no recovery, there have been absolutely striking improvements in his posture, his speaking voice, his ability to hold himself in a standing position.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>One can see displayed on a graph an &ldquo;exponential&rdquo; jump in Trevor&rsquo;s capabilities in the sixth year of his injury&mdash;trashing the accepted wisdom of the limitations of brain injury rehabilitation, says D&rsquo;Arcy. Patients with strokes or other brain injuries are usually told the greatest hope of recovery is in the first few months, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re lucky, six months, maybe a year. But after that, what you have is what you have&mdash;and that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; says D&rsquo;Arcy. While neurologists have a growing appreciation of the brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;plasticity&rdquo;&mdash;its ability to relearn, rewire and adapt&mdash;the rehabilitation community&rsquo;s ability to apply that information to patients is in its early stages, he says.</p>
    
    <p>Although the research is still incomplete, he is sharing results with brain injury and rehab experts. He doesn&rsquo;t want to give patients false hope&mdash;Trevor was superbly fit before the attack and has a soldier&rsquo;s and athlete&rsquo;s discipline in recovery&mdash;but D&rsquo;Arcy does want to impart what he calls &ldquo;brain hope, to empower patients toward taking little steps to recovery. What I routinely tell patients with brain injury is the lessons to learn from this are: you are now in the elite sport of recovering from brain injury. If you choose to do that, then you&rsquo;ll see these sorts of gains.&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>He gives Trevor credit for one of the most exciting &#64257;ndings: the impact of mental imagery. In retrospect, it seems obvious; Trevor does what many elite athletes do: he visualizes an activity, not just before the competition, or in training, but even in quiet moments. The results in his case are dramatic. The scans show that his imagined rowing is firing the same parts of the brain he&rsquo;d use on the water. The hope is that, as his brain rewires, his motor control will follow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Trevor&rsquo;s scienti&#64257;c discovery,&rdquo; says D&rsquo;Arcy. &ldquo;His discovery for rehab specialists is that mental imagery is a huge way they can help patients toward their goals.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Is it beyond the realm of possibility he will walk again? &ldquo;With Trevor, there&rsquo;s nothing beyond the realm of possibility,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I said: you don&rsquo;t make predictions on this; you&rsquo;d be proven wrong.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Accompanying me to the Greenes&rsquo; home in Nanaimo is Kevin Light, a Vancouver Island freelance photographer and a newly retired member of Canada&rsquo;s national rowing team. In more than 10 years on the national team, he has several world championships under his belt and was part of the men&rsquo;s eight crew that won an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Summer Games. He and Trevor hit it off, lapsing into rowing jargon, each understanding at least some of the other&rsquo;s drive and sacrifice.</p>
    
    <p>Over lunch, the Greenes talk of hopes and goals. &ldquo;A year from now, I&rsquo;d like to see you walking up and down our road with your walker, and only one person assisting,&rdquo; says Debbie. &ldquo;And I want to see Grace [riding her bike] saying, &lsquo;Watch me Daddy, watch me!&rsquo; And Noah,&rdquo; she says with a laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him walking, too.&rdquo; And long term? &ldquo;To row with Kevin,&rdquo; says Trevor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the boat ready,&rdquo; says Light. </p>
    
    <p>Debbie, a believer in baby steps, gives Trevor a look. &ldquo;How about we have a goal to go to Hawaii?&rdquo; she says. They were two weeks from meeting on the islands for Trevor&rsquo;s leave from Afghanistan when she was awakened with the devastating news of the attack. He gives her a fond smile: &ldquo;Maui, here we come.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>There is a point near the end of <em>March Forth</em> where Debbie asks Trevor if he would do it again&mdash;go to Afghanistan, &ldquo;knowing what would come?&rdquo; Yes, he told her, &ldquo;I would do it all again.&rdquo; Today, I ask the obvious follow-up question: <em>why</em> would you do it again? &ldquo;Afghanistan was my generation&rsquo;s chance to &#64257;ght terrorism. And &#64257;ght evil,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I often wondered if I would have gone [to &#64257;ght] in the Second World War had I been in that generation. And I would hope the answer would be yes.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>As he rebuilds mind and body, he&rsquo;s also rebooted what was already a strong sense of social engagement. He still follows events in Afghanistan, where his role as a civil-military co-operation officer was to foster ties with the Afghans. He believes Canadian forces have had a positive impact during their 10 years on the ground. Health care has improved, there are a million girls in school, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s hope for the people again,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no clear winners in wars like this. You can&rsquo;t finish with a bang&mdash;like kill Hitler and the war&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s a war on a concept: terror.&rdquo; Trevor, it seems, has much in common with the fractured physical, emotional and political landscape of Afghanistan. Can it ever heal? Certainly not by giving up on it, in Trevor&rsquo;s view.</p>
    
    <p>With his days as a soldier behind him, he&rsquo;s become an outspoken environmentalist. He&rsquo;s in the midst of writing another book on what he sees as Canada&rsquo;s many environmental transgressions, from the proposed Enbridge pipeline across B.C. to the government&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. </p>
    
    <p>The conversation turns to Debbie, gone to pick up Grace from school. She made hope when there was none, never accepting the limits that doctors and rehabilitation specialists put on her broken husband in those first horrible years. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be drooling in some long-term care facility if not for her, watching soap operas and looking at my feet,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My love for her grew, and my respect, because at every corner, they were telling her &lsquo;no.&rsquo; But she fought like a lioness and made it a &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; Not a maybe. A yes.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>In this, they are a brilliant match: happy with the life they have, but fighting to regain what they had. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rehab athlete. My gold medal is walking,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;People say I&rsquo;m brave, they admire me for my courage. But I don&rsquo;t see how anybody could be content like this&mdash;if they have the possibility of walking again, of regaining full function.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Little Noah and I are flopped on a raised exercise mat at one end of the Greenes&rsquo; double garage. It&rsquo;s crowded with exercise equipment and boxes left from a recent move. A combat jacket in desert camouflage hangs from a hook on the wall. A golf bag leans in a corner, gathering dust. Trevor has already sweated through an hour of workout with physiotherapist Edna Ricafrente. Martin Gruys, a friend and physio assistant, arrives to offer added muscle to support Trevor&rsquo;s weight and to work him through demanding lower-body exercises. </p>
    
    <p>Today, Gruys is here for the main event. Trevor heaves out of the chair, grabbing the bars of an aluminum walker, his arm muscles straining with the effort. The chair is pushed back. Debbie has strapped on knee pads and is crouched behind him. Ricafrente is on one side of him and Gruys the other. Debbie prods one foot and then the other, and Trevor slides them forward about 10 cm a time. Baby steps. He has visualized this often. He has practised it in the pool, aided by the water&rsquo;s buoyancy. But it&rsquo;s only been two weeks since he&rsquo;s been making these steps on land. Damned if Capt. Greene isn&rsquo;t marching forth. </p>
    
    <p>The thing about walking is this: it&rsquo;s not solely a brain-to-leg function. There is what D&rsquo;Arcy calls a central pattern generator&mdash;&ldquo;a little microprocessor in the spine&rdquo;&mdash;that helps produce rhythmic movements. You can think about walking in the abstract but you don&rsquo;t really think about the process of moving your legs <em>when</em> you&rsquo;re walking, any more than you think about taking the next breath. It&rsquo;s a complicated ballet of balance, coordination and momentum you take for granted until it is stolen from you. But Trevor and Debbie have seen the scans. They&rsquo;ve seen that the brain has found a path around the gaps and scars left by that axe. His brain knows how to walk again in theory; now it&rsquo;s a question of getting the body back on board.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little like rowing,&rdquo; Light says from behind his camera. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t win it all at once. It&rsquo;s inch by inch by inch.&rdquo; Trevor locks eyes with a fellow athlete and grunts in agreement. &ldquo;That right shoulder is too far forward,&rdquo; says Debbie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re walking better every time,&rdquo; says Gruys, as they reach the end of the garage. &ldquo;You want to rest or go straight on?&rdquo; Gruys asks. &ldquo;Straight on,&rdquo; says Trevor. Lap four: Debbie is beaming.  </p>
    
    <p>Noah is clutching one of my fingers, his blue eyes&mdash;Daddy&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;more intent on scoping out this stranger in the house than on the miracle of determination playing out in a suburban garage. I gather him on my lap so he can get a better view of Daddy, now on his fifth crossing of the garage. Perhaps at some level, he processes the sound of his father&rsquo;s laboured breathing, sees the sweat on his brow, hears the excited voices of Dad&rsquo;s support unit. The determination has always shone through, but there is something else today. There is triumph. Noah seems unimpressed, but maybe he senses that <em>something</em>in Daddy&rsquo;s eyes. Who knows what is firing inside a five-month-old&rsquo;s brain? Not something to underestimate. Not anymore.    </p>

  <body.content>
    <p>Could a tiny, rocky, uninhabited island in the Bay of Fundy ignite the Canadian-American War of 2013? That&rsquo;s the ominous prospect raised recently by Stephen Kelly, a professor at the Center for Canadian Studies at Duke University in North Carolina. Writing in the <em>New York Times</em>, the retired American diplomat, who twice served in Canada, called for the two countries to settle sovereignty of Machias Seal Island, which lies nearly equidistant between Maine and New Brunswick. Kelly&rsquo;s concern is the 720 sq. km of water around the island, a magnet for American and Canadian lobster fishermen.</p>
    
    <p>Kelly wants it sorted out now, while stakes are low: with no oil in the area and the current lobster glut, this is &ldquo;an ideal time to colour in the grey zone,&rdquo; he writes.</p>
    
    <p>Canada&rsquo;s official position is that there&rsquo;s nothing to colour in. John Williamson, MP for New Brunswick Southwest, notes the island is in his riding. A statement from the federal government claims sovereignty is &ldquo;strongly founded in international law.&rdquo; Ralph Eldridge, the island&rsquo;s lightkeeper for the past 16 years, told <em>Canadian Press</em> he &ldquo;never needed his passport to go there.&rdquo; Certainly the 81,000-sq.-m site, home to a seabird sanctuary, appears Canuck: the Maple Leaf waves freely and the Canadian Coast Guard tends it. </p>
    
    <p>But Kelly tells <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em> the island is the last land mass in contention between the two countries. He owns a house nearby in Maine and has watched lobster &ldquo;shredders&rdquo; from both countries overfish the area. That, coupled with recent violent outbursts between Japan and China over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, sounded alarm bells. &ldquo;Territorial disputes can turn nasty when you least expect it.&rdquo;</p>

   <hedline>On the edge  of a debris  invasion</hedline>
   
    <p>For 21 months, a 20-metre concrete and steel dock floated across the Pacific from Japan only to wash ashore just before Christmas on a remote beach on Washington&rsquo;s Olympic Peninsula. Researchers think it&rsquo;s part of a 1.5-million-tonne debris field adrift in the ocean after an earthquake-generated tsunami smashed into the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011&mdash;and a harbinger of a greater mess due to hit the North American coastline in the next few months.</p>
    
    <p>Governments from Alaska, B.C., Washington, Oregon and California are co-operating with their federal counterparts and local governments on clean-up plans and strategies to deal with anything that makes land&mdash;including aquatic species not native to North America&mdash;as the winter storm season reaches its peak. The latest report from the Japanese environment ministry said most light, wind-blown debris like Styrofoam and buoys have already hit the Alaskan and B.C. coasts. Lumber, much of it from houses ripped apart by the tsunami, is expected to hit the coast between now and June, though tracking what remains afloat is an inexact science. Other debris discovered to date includes a fishing boat and a motorcycle in a shipping container.</p>
    
    <p>The origin of the Olympic Peninsula dock has yet to be confirmed. Researchers are testing for radioactivity and to ensure the array of sea life attached to it doesn&rsquo;t include invasive species from Japan. The nearest communities to the site are Forks and La Push, famous haunts in the <em>Twilight</em> series of books and movies, and a suitably eerie setting. A similar 150-tonne dock that washed ashore in Oregon in June proved to be an ecological nightmare, home to no less than four invasive species native to Japan. It was sterilized with blowtorches before it was cut up and hauled away.</p>

     <slug>Who&rsquo;s suing whom</slug>
  
   <hedline>Jailhouse shock and spoiled wine</hedline>
   
  <p>British Columbia: A civil lawsuit has been launched against four manufacturers of gas fireplaces alleging their products are &ldquo;defective and dangerous.&rdquo; The lawsuit was filed in B.C. Supreme Court by Craig and Charity Cantlie. Their one-year-old son Owen suffered second-degree burns to his right hand when he touched their fireplace&rsquo;s glass front.</p>
  
  <p>Saskatchewan: Five inmates at Saskatchewan Penitentiary in Prince Albert, serving sentences for murders, rapes and home invasions, are suing the federal government, arguing their detentions are &ldquo;inflicting extreme stress and nervous shock.&rdquo; The group, seeking damages of $50,000, cites grievances such as sleep deprivation and a lack of a barber.</p>
   
  <p>Manitoba: In 2011 Rodney McKnight was in a wheelchair inside the Brandon Regional Health Centre when a man jumped from a balcony four stories above and landed on him. The jumper later died, while McKnight claims in a lawsuit filed in December he suffered mental trauma and physical injuries. McKnight claims the hospital failed to make the area safe after a woman fell to her death from the same spot seven months before.</p>
  
  <p>Ontario: Marineland, the Niagara Falls attraction hit by allegations of animal abuse last summer, filed a $1.25-million defamation suit against a former trainer turned critic. The suit alleges Christine Santos, who had worked at Marineland for 12 years before being fired, made false claims to the media about the abuse and neglect of Kiska, an Orca whale, and then refused to retract her comments when confronted by the company.</p>
  
  <p>Quebec: A Montreal wine collector who stored his collection at a facility operated by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Alcools du Qu&eacute;bec filed a $1-million suit against the agency alleging it ruined his collection. Robert Chiraz stored 3,000 bottles at the facility in 2009, but the next year he discovered mould and harmful bacteria around the cellar and on the bottles, making them unsaleable.</p>

  <p>From cake to near blows</p>
  
  <p>As Parliament wound down for 2012 it literally almost came to blows between Government House leader Peter Van Loan (known as PVL on the Hill) and two Opposition members: NDP House leader Nathan Cullen and NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair. PVL was upset at Cullen because the NDP attempted to use procedure to delay the budget and force another vote on the bill. PVL came over and told Cullen to never try that again. This is far cry from when Cullen and Van Loan started working together as House leaders and PVL made him a cake to welcome him into his new position. (Van Loan is known to dabble in Martha Stewart recipes).</p>
  
  <p>If tensions continue to boil over once Parliament resumes, and things get physical again, it&rsquo;s opportune to consider the fighting strengths of all the official national parties. If it comes to a fight on the floor of the House of Commons, here then are the politicians to watch: </p>
  
  <p>On the Conservative side is cage fighter Ryan Leef. The Yukon MP is a mixed martial arts fighter who has been inside the Armageddon Fighting Championship&rsquo;s octagon. Dan Albas, the Conservative who replaced Stockwell Day in the B.C. riding of Okanagan-Coquihalla, worked as a mixed martial arts instructor. His martial arts studio was called Kick City Martial Arts. </p>
  
  <p>On the Liberal fighting side, leadership candidate Justin Trudeau still holds the title for best physical scrapper after he famously defeated black belt Conservative Sen. Patrick Brazeau in a charity boxing match. Newfoundland MP Scott Simms told Capital Diary he has &ldquo;some&rdquo; boxing experience. The petite MP, who often makes fun of his lack of height, confesses he would not be an ideal first wave fighter. </p>
  
  <p>On the NDP side is a mixed bag of fighters. Quebec MP Mathieu Ravignat (who beat former foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon in the last election) is a sensei at the Wakefield Traditional Karate Association as well as a member of the Ottawa Medieval Sword Guild which, according to their website, is &ldquo;a company of men-at-arms specializing in 14th-century combat, dedicated to the restoration of traditional Western martial arts.&rdquo; Quebec MP Christine Moore served in the Canadian Forces and was an emergency room and intensive care nurse. Quebec MP Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Larose is a former prison guard. Ontario MP Glenn Thibeault holds a brown belt in balintawak, a form of Filipino martial arts. B.C. MP Jinny Sims has a black belt in judo and is a fencer. During a debate about citizens&rsquo; arrests, she told the House: &ldquo;I have a black belt in judo. I have taught judo and have accidentally hurt a person very close to me because he insisted that I show him how it is done. He did not have the sense to fall when I asked him to fall.&rdquo; </p>
  
  <p>The NDP&rsquo;s secret weapon is Alex Atamanenko, a 67-year-old MP representing the B.C. riding of Southern Interior. He is lean and grey bearded, but Atamanenko was an officer in the Canadian Forces who has a fourth degree black belt. He currently sits in the last row of the House on the opposition side. NDP deputy leader Libby Davies sits next to Mulcair. When Capital Diary asked if she should perhaps move her seat to allow one of the martial arts MPs from her caucus to sit beside their leader, Davies quipped, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m from East Van!&rdquo;</p>

    <hedline>Watching Hillary</hedline>
    
    <abstract>Clinton is exiting the political stage&mdash;to become a grandma, she says. No one believes her. And almost 60 per cent of Americans want her to run for the presidency again.</abstract>

    <p>The U.S. secretary of state has been making the media rounds saying she&rsquo;s ready to leave&mdash;to be a grandma, to travel for fun, to teach and, above all, to sleep. But nobody quite believes that she isn&rsquo;t planning another run for the White House. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t believe that that&rsquo;s something I will do again,&rdquo; Hillary Clinton told interviewer Barbara Walters recently. But, asked whether, at the age of 69, she&rsquo;d be too old to run, she bristled: &ldquo;I am, thankfully, knock on wood, not only healthy, but have incredible stamina and energy.&rdquo; Clinton&rsquo;s hospitalization on Sunday for a blood clot may have cast a shadow on that optimism. The clot stemmed from a concussion she sustained after fainting from dehydration due to a severe stomach virus, and doctors were confident about her recovery. But the string of illnesses has forced her to cancel most of her engagements for the better part of a month, and is an unforeseen setback as she wraps up her tenure as secretary of state.  </p>
    
    <p>Of course, Clinton has more than optimism on her side. She exits with one of the highest approval ratings on the national stage, 66 per cent (10 points higher than President Barack Obama), and 57 per cent of Americans say she should run again, according to a <em>Washington Post</em>-ABC News poll.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Stamina&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do it justice either. In the past four years, Clinton has logged more than 950,000 travel miles, according to an official tally. She has visited a record 112 countries.</p>
    
    <p>And the former first lady travels no-frills. She sleeps on a fold-out couch in a spartan private cabin aboard a government Boeing 757 equipped with extra fuel tanks for her marathon trips. Her small room has a desk, a TV monitor and a full-length mirror. No shower.</p>
    
    <p>And no stylist. When Clinton let her hair grow long on the job, the <em>Washington Post</em> called it her &ldquo;latest act of defiance.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was a fine rebuke to the accepted adage that a woman of a certain age must cut her hair&mdash;a symbolic gesture that she is leaving sex appeal and youthful flirtatiousness behind,&rdquo; opined the paper&rsquo;s fashion writer. Her ponytails and &rsquo;80s-era hair accessories were scrutinized. One official was quoted confiding, &ldquo;Some of us are looking to ban the scrunchies.&rdquo; Clinton just laughed. &ldquo;I do not travel with any hairdresser, or anybody to help me do that, and I&rsquo;m not very competent myself,&rdquo; she told Walters. &ldquo;And so it became simpler to just grow it so that I can pull it back, and I can stick rollers in.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>That kind of no-nonsense sensibility, reflected in her iconic pantsuits, have endeared Clinton to the kind of voters who just couldn&rsquo;t relate to the suave Obama or the millionaire Mitt Romney: the hard-working &ldquo;waitress moms,&rdquo; as political consultants labelled them in the 2012 elections. Or, as they proved themselves to be in the closely fought 2008 Democratic primary contest, the Hillary voters.</p>
    
    <p>After she was elected a junior senator from New York in 2000, Clinton took a small basement office and worked across the aisle on nuts-and-bolts issues, earning grudging respect from Republicans. That approach prepared her for the job in Obama-land, which was largely enemy territory, thick with fears that she would plot to undermine the new President or that her husband&rsquo;s global foundation would present conflicts of interest. But she won over the Obama loyalists.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I think that she has done an extraordinary job,&rdquo; says David Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Canada. &ldquo;I say that as someone who, quite frankly, spent two years of his life working on a campaign to keep her from being the Democratic nominee for president. She knows that, and despite that she has been unfailingly kind and gracious and co-operative with me&mdash;and when I talk to colleagues around the world who were in the same position I was in, they tell me the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Foreign policy analysts saw no discord. &ldquo;Everybody was saying, &lsquo;This is going to be a mess, there is bad blood, wheels are going to come off,&rsquo; &rdquo; recalls Charles Kupchan, an international affairs professor at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. &ldquo;And I would say it&rsquo;s been one of the smoothest, most effective teams in a very long time.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Clinton pledged to transform America&rsquo;s role abroad through &ldquo;smart power&rdquo;&mdash;a marriage of development and diplomacy. She emphasized her lifelong concern for women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s issues. She sought to put a civilian face on U.S. actions abroad by empowering diplomats to take a leading operational role while working alongside U.S. military and intelligence personnel. &ldquo;T</p>
    
    <p>he idea was to make the ambassador into a CEO&mdash;to give the ambassadors more training and tools to effectively manage the situation,&rdquo; said Jordan Tama, who teaches at the School of International Service at American University in Washington. Clinton also changed internal job evaluations to reward diplomats who take risks. </p>
    
    <p>The result has been a more assertive diplomatic corps, says Kupchan: &ldquo;We came off a decade in which American foreign policy was over-militarized and in which the State Department had lost a good bit of influence to the Pentagon, and I think under Clinton&rsquo;s tenure two things have happened: the State Department clawed back power from the military, and now there is a more balanced relationship between the two; and the State Department&rsquo;s portfolio, which during the [George W.] Bush years was more traditional, has been diversified. Women&rsquo;s issues, human development issues, questions of good governance, a lot of things that were in the shadows are now front and centre.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Jacobson agrees, saying he observed &ldquo;a focus on areas such as &lsquo;economic statecraft&rsquo; that she refers to, that have been very important here in Canada.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>But for all that, Michael O&rsquo;Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, says Clinton remained focused on hard power. &ldquo;She was a very traditional, realpolitik secretary. She was focused first and foremost on the country&rsquo;s core security interests and core relationships, and I think she did that well. It&rsquo;s not a tenure marked by a breakthrough with any country or problem. It was a very pragmatic, workmanlike, solid legacy.&rdquo; O&rsquo;Hanlon adds,</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;People will think of her as one of the hardest-working, best-prepared, most meticulous secretaries of state&mdash;and one of the least naive about how the world works.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Clinton helped drive the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;pivot to Asia&rdquo;&mdash;and its policy toward China. There, &ldquo;she might have had her greatest direct impact, and a big hand in setting the tone,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Hanlon. </p>
    
    <p>The biggest black mark on her tenure, of course, was the Sept. 11 attacks on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Clinton commissioned an inquiry into security lapses, which concluded that there was a failure of leadership on diplomatic security, but did not name names. &ldquo;Because those flaws occurred during secretary Clinton&rsquo;s watch, they represent chinks in her armour,&rdquo; says Kupchan. Three State Department officials resigned in the wake of the report. Clinton was scheduled to testify before Congress in December, but cancelled due to her injury. So far, Clinton herself has avoided being tarred by the debacle, but Republicans are sure to raise it if she runs in 2016.</p>
    
    <p>The landscape certainly looks inviting: one recent poll showed that 61 per cent of Democrats want her as their next candidate. But people close to Clinton have said she has not made any decisions. Wisely so. Back in 2007, she had the support of 51 per cent of Democrats, more than double that of a little-known senator from Illinois who won a year later. And there are still four years to go.    </p>

    <p>Debora Accomando was working at 42nd and 3rd in midtown New York on Sept. 11, 2001, when the twin towers came down. The then-27-year-old recruiter managed to reach her brother, who was also in New York, and after talking to their parents they walked north to 125th Street. There were crowds of people doing the same, many covered in ash and walking in zombie-like silence away from the horror of downtown. &ldquo;It was like something out of the <em>Thriller</em> video,&rdquo; Debora says today. When &#64257;ghter jets &#64258;ew over, she heard their echoing roar and was sure they were being attacked again.</p>
    
    <p>She and her husband, Robert, a real estate lawyer, decided within days that they would leave their rented top &#64258;oor of a house in the New York suburb of Bronxville. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want the post-9/11 reality. We were just like, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go somewhere where we don&rsquo;t get anthrax in the subway, where you don&rsquo;t have to worry about sarin gas or the water supply.&rsquo; That was the conversation then, that the terrorists were going to come at us through the subway or the ports. We wanted to go where we could live a quiet life of anonymity and peace.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>They quit their jobs and in January 2002 moved into their contemporary colonial house at the top of a long, winding driveway in Newtown, Conn., about a 90-minute drive from New York City. There they brought three boys into the world, each three years apart. Soon enough their yearly pig roasts were a hit; a recent one included some 150 people and a purpose-built vodka-shot ice luge. Last year, two of their boys, now 6 and 9, joined Newtown&rsquo;s wrestling club; the youngest, now three, joined this year.</p>
    
    <p>The move to Newtown, says Robert, 46, was prompted by &ldquo;a combination of a terrible event, the need for safety and security, and the desire to get away from the craziness of the world. My thinking was just that: to get away from the craziness of the world and make babies. And until that weekend, that&rsquo;s exactly what Newtown was.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>That weekend, as the world now knows, began Friday, Dec. 14, when a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people, including 20 children, before turning his gun on himself. Until then, Newtown was perhaps better known for hardly being known at all&mdash;a slice of cheery, tree-lined New England oblivion tucked in close to the New York State border.</p>
    
    <p>Overnight, the town became clogged with strangers coming to stage its grief, and with television trucks to broadcast the town&rsquo;s misery across the country and the world. The size and ferocity of the rampage&mdash;several victims couldn&rsquo;t have an open-casket funeral because of what Adam Lanza&rsquo;s bullets did to their young bodies&mdash;has brought fresh urgency to the entrenched debate over gun control in the U.S.</p>
    
    <p>It is a mark of the power and in&#64258;uence of the gun lobby that America has remained stubbornly status quo when it comes to allowing its citizens to arm themselves, despite the steady stream of bodies resulting from various shootings over the years. Yet the scale of this rampage, and the young age of Lanza&rsquo;s victims, has seemingly jolted the nation awake. It&rsquo;s a horrifying number: roughly seven per cent of Newtown&rsquo;s Grade 1 students were wiped out within a matter of minutes, many of them shot multiple times as their classmates watched. In a country all too prone to frequent mass killings by people with legal (and usually legally obtained) &#64257;rearms, Newtown isn&rsquo;t just another cautionary tale; it is, perhaps, the beginning of the end of the gun lobby&rsquo;s political sway.</p>
    
    <p>Away from the media circus of Sandy Hook and the political drama playing out around them, Newtown&rsquo;s citizens struggle to cope even as the shell shock had barely lifted. Some kids are lashing out at their parents; some have refused to go to school outright; others still have wondered out loud how they can survive if they get shot in the chest next time they leave the house. In the kitchens and living rooms of Newtown, a place that will never again be the same, life goes painfully on.</p>
    
    <p>Newtown is what you might call rustic suburbia. Its narrow streets&mdash;almost too narrow for its many minivans&mdash;wind around stone hedges and wood-panelled subdivisions, and have names like Patriot Ridge, Schoolhouse Hill Road and Sealand Drive. The town is best known for its &#64258;agpole, which sits smack in the middle of the town&rsquo;s busiest intersection, Main Street and Church Hill Road. It has endured despite being an obvious traf&#64257;c hazard, if only because Newtowners are so proud of it. The attitude of locals is this: it&rsquo;s simple. It&rsquo;s a &#64258;agpole. Don&rsquo;t hit it.</p>
    
    <p>Robert and Debora live about a 10-minute drive away, in the Sandy Hook section of the town. Friday, Dec. 14, began as most days here. They got their three boys up, fed them and shovelled the two oldest, nine-year-old Robbie and six-year-old Danny, out the door to school. Their youngest, three-year-old Steven, puttered around the house while Robert and Debora, who operate their own recruiting agency from home, worked at their computers.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I was doing something Christmas-related,&rdquo; Debora says, &ldquo;and I get this email from the school district&rsquo;s emergency messaging system. It said there was a shooting at one of the schools. I thought it was a joke. Then I saw the email heading, and saw it was actually from the school district.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The two turned to social media, where they quickly &#64257;gured out that the incident was at Sandy Hook, not Hawley Elementary School, where their boys went. That they weren&rsquo;t at Sandy Hook was the result of a twitch one year in the school-zone dividing line between Sandy Hook and Hawley; the family actually lives closer to Sandy Hook.</p>
    
    <p>Hawley was under lockdown, they found out. Their kids were safe. On their respective Facebook pages, Robert and Debora read that the news wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it might have been.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;The reports we were getting were saying that only three people had to be taken to the hospital, and we heard that the shooter was already dead,&rdquo; says Debora, a petite 40-year-old with dark hair. &ldquo;And then it went from three injured and the shooter dead to the fact that hundreds of rounds were used. Three injured and 100 rounds didn&rsquo;t equal up.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Multiple injuries is the latest. Trying to reach friends whose kids are there now. Want to puke,&rdquo; Robert wrote on his Facebook page at 10:16 a.m. &ldquo;Possibly two shooters in the school,&rdquo; he wrote 17 minutes later.</p>
    
    <p>At 10:36, Robert wrote, &ldquo;One shooter is dead.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t yet know that the violence was over, or that 26 people lay dead. Five minutes later: &ldquo;Shooter went to main of&#64257;ce and shot several times. One shooter is still at large.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Right around this point, Robert wrote a quick, angry post about the anti-gun lobby, and how he wished he had a &#64257;rearm in his house to ward off the second shooter, apparently loose in his neighbourhood. But he quickly erased the post and went to get his air ri&#64258;e. He loaded it and propped it near the door.</p>
    
    <p>On CNN, Robert watched as a SWAT team approached a shed on the Sandy Hook Elementary grounds, guns drawn. He recognized it immediately. Robert was treasurer of the Newtown wrestling team, and father of three budding wrestlers; he&rsquo;d been in the steel storage locker next to that shed not 48 hours before, putting away the team&rsquo;s gear. &ldquo;I spend 2&frac12; hours, three nights a week in that school. The only place I spend more time than Sandy Hook is my own home.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>At the same time, Robert was messaging with Curtis Urbina, a coach with the team. &ldquo;Someone please &#64257;nd Jack Pinto. He is with Ben Wheeler,&rdquo; Urbina wrote at 1:32 p.m. At 3:13, Robert wrote to Urbina, asking the coach to call him. The two didn&rsquo;t talk, however, and at 3:19 Robert wrote, &ldquo;I con&#64257;rmed some bad news.&rdquo; Both Jack Pinto, 6, and Ben Wheeler, also 6, were dead.</p>
    
    <p>The news &#64258;ooded in to them as it did all of Newtown. They picked their kids up, got them home. They watched the news, got the &#64257;nal tally of the dead, then cried and cried and cried. The Accomandos are Italian-American; saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; is common practice at the best of times. In the wake of the shootings, it became something of a mantra chanted between Robert and Debora and their kids. &ldquo;I love you, go put on your shoes.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you, go to bed.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you, stop yelling.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you, eat.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>They woke up Saturday morning in a fog. They &#64257;gured the victims&rsquo; families would need to eat. Sixteen families came to the Accomando house. The adults crowded into their kitchen, making spaghetti sauce on the gas range, chopping vegetables on the centre island in their kitchen and packing the food into boxes, which they carried out to their cars through the basement garage. The Hook, a restaurant in town, donated cooked food and transportation to complement the families&rsquo; efforts.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We did it to stop crying, to get rid of that sense of deep helplessness about how many people we knew. As Italian-Americans, we decided that we should start cooking,&rdquo; Robert says. &ldquo;We were going to the store, and we were like, &lsquo;Why are we just doing this for the Pintos? Let&rsquo;s &#64257;nd out who got killed, and do it for everyone.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>In the following days, parents stopping by the Accomandos shared some of the stories going around, like the Sandy Hook teacher who managed to escape Lanza&rsquo;s bullets by crawling out a meeting room window, sure Lanza would shoot her as she ran for safety. There was the school&rsquo;s janitorial staff, who managed to stymie Lanza&rsquo;s progress by going up and down the halls to make sure the doors were locked as the shooter roamed the school.</p>
    
    <p>Then there was the father who was walking into Sandy Hook Elementary to decorate gingerbread houses with his daughter and members of her Brownie troop, only to be met with a panicked tide of bloodied children running out of the building. His daughter survived; most of her Brownie troop died.</p>
    
    <p>There were also tales of incredible bravery. A kid named J.J. was in Victoria Soto&rsquo;s &#64257;rst-grade class when Lanza burst in. Lanza shot Soto, who was shielding her students, but his gun either jammed or he had to reload. J.J., an adept player of the <em>Call of Duty</em> video game&mdash;the very same game with which Lanza was obsessed&mdash;knew that the time to move was during a lull in &#64257;ring. He led &#64257;ve other kids out of the school to the nearby driveway of Gene Rosen. J.J. told Rosen that they couldn&rsquo;t go back to class, because their teacher was dead.</p>
    
    <p>The group delivered meals to eight affected families that Saturday. One fellow dropped off sauce, uncooked pasta and bread at the residence of Anne Marie Murphy, one of the teachers slain the day before. He was so nervous that he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to knock on the door. He left the food on the doorstep and walked quickly away.</p>
    
    <p>Debora later got a phone call from Alice, Anne Marie&rsquo;s sister, who teaches Debora&rsquo;s youngest boy at preschool. She told Debora how grateful she and her family were for the food. They&rsquo;d practically forgotten to eat, and were so hungry that they didn&rsquo;t bother cooking the pasta. They just ripped open the sauce container and dunked the bread straight into it.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Sunday came, and we said, &lsquo;What are we going to do, cook again?&rsquo; &rdquo; Robert says. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t do it. We only reached eight families. We thought, &lsquo;What else could we do? What is going to happen to the families when the cameras leave and the attention fades?&rsquo; We wanted to do something other than watch CNN and cry.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>And so began the My Sandy Hook Family Fund. &ldquo;We are the parents of the children who survived,&rdquo; the group&rsquo;s mission statement reads. &ldquo;We are the classmates, friends and the little league coaches. Sandy Hook is where we live&mdash;it is our proud community. We ask the world to join us not only in our grief but also in our burning need to take some of the burdens off these families in their time of incredible pain. To bear their cross in some small way.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The donations, the group decided, would be put toward paying for funerals and funeral clothes, food, mortgage payments and whatever other expenses the 26 families of victims incurred as they grieved. At the funeral for Jack Pinto, who was on the same wrestling team as the Accomando boys, Robert had heard that the family of another young victim had to empty their bank account to pay for the funeral.</p>
    
    <p>The group set a fundraising goal of $2.6 million&mdash;$100,000 for each family. One hundred per cent of the proceeds would go to the victims&rsquo; families. By Monday morning they had $27,000, and more than $100,000 by that evening.</p>
    
    <p>Monday brought different and disturbing challenges to the community. Someone had called in bomb threats to Hawley, Robbie and Danny&rsquo;s school. It brought a new sense of paranoia to the Accomandos&mdash;although, given what had happened, it was hardly paranoia at all. &ldquo;We were told that there were going to be cops in the schools, but then we thought, &lsquo;Well, what happens if crazy people start shooting at the school buses?&rsquo; &rdquo; Robert says. &ldquo;So we said we&rsquo;d drive them to school.&rdquo; In the end they just stayed home, even though Hawley opened its doors that day.</p>
    
    <p>On Wednesday night, &#64257;ve days after the shooting, Robert and Debora brought their kids to the &#64257;rst wrestling meet since the tragedy. An uninformed stranger might be charmed by the sheer normalcy of the thing. Held at a community sports centre in nearby Danbury, it had all the trappings of any other meet: kids lined up, &#64257;rst for stretches, then for shot and sprawl drills. The three-year-olds followed exactly what the older kids did, barrelling through the drills with tiger-cub intensity. Parents milled about, keeping an eye on their kids when they weren&rsquo;t talking to each other. Every 30 seconds or so, coach Christopher Bray blew his whistle to start or stop a drill.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Those kids in that room tonight were the last kids to wrestle with Jack Pinto,&rdquo; Robert would say later. On Thursday, Dec. 13, Pinto had a league match against the Ridge&#64257;eld wrestling club. &ldquo;Jack went home on Thursday night, went to school the next day and was killed with his class.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>But the tragedy didn&rsquo;t keep kids from being kids. At the wrestling meet, they bounced off the rubberized mats, barely contained by coach Bray&rsquo;s whistle. They&rsquo;d zoom off to the equipment room to collect their ear guards when it was time to spar. They&rsquo;d demand cookies after the practice, and there was a good chance they&rsquo;d fall asleep during the car ride home. Liz Luzietti&rsquo;s son Shane, 10, was a friend of Jack&rsquo;s, and at practice he was as aggressive as ever.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Shane&rsquo;s like that,&rdquo; says Luzietti. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s intense on the mat, but he&rsquo;s really a mush, always touching my face. Now he doesn&rsquo;t feel safe with all these strangers. He&rsquo;s suddenly petri&#64257;ed that we&rsquo;re going to be late for everything. And he&rsquo;s lashing out, telling me he hates me. I&rsquo;m just trying to ride it out,&rdquo; she says, her huge, friendly eyes rimmed with tears.</p>
    
    <p>In the days following the shooting, Robert and Debora kept a close watch on their three boys for signs of . . . well, anything, actually. There wasn&rsquo;t much, other than an excitement (and then annoyance) at all the strangers traipsing through the house. It was almost like nothing had happened. Then, on Sunday night, nine-year-old Robbie heard his school was going to be closed the next day, and he was sure he knew why. &ldquo;He said Hawley was closed because the school was trying to fake out the people who were going to bomb it,&rdquo; Debora says.</p>
    
    <p>On that same night, their middle kid, Danny, was getting ready for bed with his dad. &ldquo;If I get shot, do I have to die? Is it automatic? Do I disappear, like with a phaser in a video game?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;No, it depends on where you get shot,&rdquo; Robert answered.</p>
    
    <p>Danny pointed to his belly. &ldquo;What if I get shot here?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Why are you asking me this? You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it,&rdquo; Robert said.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I know, just tell me what I need to do,&rdquo; Danny answered.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Well, &#64257;rst you need to put pressure where the bleeding is. But you really don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I want to know, just in case,&rdquo; Danny said. He then jumped into his father&rsquo;s arms and they went to Danny&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;It was like he was just working out in his head, logically, what he had to do if that happened,&rdquo; Robert would say later. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t emotional at all, just matter-of-fact.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Living while so many of those close to them have died has taken its toll on parents as well. &ldquo;You almost feel bad because your kid survived, and theirs didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Chris Manfredi, the president of the wrestling club, whose own son, Luca, wrestled with Jack. &ldquo;Basically, I feel like an asshole for feeling bad. They have the right to feel bad, not me.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>On Saturday, Dec. 22, My Sandy Hook Family Fund cracked $500,000&mdash;about a &#64257;fth of the way to its $2.6-million goal. &ldquo;There is also a stack of cheques over a foot high at the bank,&rdquo; Robert wrote in an email.</p>
    
    <p>He can&rsquo;t wait for it to be over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people thinking I have delusions of grandeur. I don&rsquo;t want to be alienated from the community I live in,&rdquo; he says, sighing. &ldquo;When this is all over I just want to disappear.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>On Sunday, nine days after the shooting, Debora and some friends went to the Wheelers to clean their house. The warehouse in town was &#64257;lling up with donations of clothes, food and toys from around the world, just as the media trucks began leaving their week-long perch on the banks of the Pootatuck River at the centre of Sandy Hook. Traf&#64257;c through town became a little more bearable as the &#64258;ow of mourners abated. In Newtown, barely a week after the calamity, life was settling into whatever normal will be from now on.    </p>

    <abstract>Behind their bad reputation, drug and alcohol use and anti-social behaviour is down among young Britons</abstract>

  <photo.caption>Crunch time: With tuition rising, some youth argue that they can no longer afford to act out</photo.caption>
    
  <photo.byline>LUKE MACGREGOR</photo.byline>
    
  <body.content>
    <p>The vision of Britain as a teenage wasteland full of drunk and disaffected kids is as old as the notion of modern youth culture itself. And in times like these&mdash;coloured by high unemployment, rising tuition costs, cuts to social welfare and a steadily declining marriage rate (resulting in an increase of single-parent families)&mdash;it seems a no-brainer that the youth of today would be doing what bored, broke, idle kids are famed for doing best: getting wasted and raising hell.</p>
    
    <p>And yet, oddly enough, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
    
    <p>According to a recent crime survey, all statistical indicators show that British kids are all right&mdash;though not in the way the Who meant it. Instead of acting out in hard times, young Britons of today are, counterintuitively, much better behaved than before the recession.</p>
    
    <p>In 1998, 71 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds said they&rsquo;d consumed alcohol in the previous week, but in 2010, that number fell to just 48 per cent. Teenage drug use has dropped almost 10 percentage points in the same period. School truancy rates have fallen in recent years, along with youth criminality and teen pregnancies, which are down an encouraging quarter since 1998.</p>
    
    <p>In the country&rsquo;s recent police elections, many aspiring crime commissioners campaigned on a platform to curb &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; among young people. And yet, according to a recent survey, Britons in their late teens and early 20s are less likely to be rude or disruptive in public than previous generations.</p>
    
    <p>If all this is true, why does the misperception of disaffected youth still hold?</p>
    
    <p>Rosina St. James, a 22-year-old student at the London School of Economics and Chair of the British Youth Council, an organization that advocates for youth in social policy and government, lays the blame squarely at the feet of Britain&rsquo;s rowdy media. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s de&#64257;nitely a misrepresentation of young people in this country, an imbalance between the perceived attitude and the actual reality,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bad news travels fast, and if you&rsquo;re part of the media, you want a sensational story that people will pick up and read.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Visit any newsstand and you will see plenty of tabloid stories about youthful pill-poppers, sidewalk-pukers and petty criminals alike. The <em>Daily Mail,</em> in particular, has made a cottage industry of publishing photo spreads devoted to the drunken nights out of young celebrities and everyday hooligans, their ripped stockings, bloodied noses and badly applied self-tanner evidence of a so-called &ldquo;broken Britain&rdquo; that may not actually exist.</p>
    
    <p>Binge drinking, the pastime British youth are best known for, peaked a decade ago and has been declining ever since, according to a report by the Institute of Alcohol Studies.</p>
    
    <p>But another factor guiding public perception is the lingering aftertaste of the 2011 riots&mdash;which saw thousands of young people participate in dozens of riots over five days across the country, and resulted in more than 3,000 arrests. A government report published last spring concluded that myriad factors were to blame, including youth unemployment, poor parenting, weakness of the justice system, materialism and mistrust of the police. Crucially, however, the report also found that most of those convicted of crimes had long criminal records&mdash;which suggests the worst of the riots were spurred by a violent, anti-social minority of young people, rather than an entire generation of disaffected British youth.</p>
    
    <p>Ask St. James what her generation is like and she speaks of resilience and optimism&mdash;a wave of young people fighting to make their place in the world through earnest community engagement, rather than old-fashioned rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll rebellion. Her organization recently made a submission to the Leveson inquiry requesting &ldquo;fairer representation for young people in the media.&rdquo; She says: &ldquo;There are lots of positive signs, but they are almost never highlighted.&rdquo; One such story is an increase in civic engagement. The British Youth Parliament saw voter turnout increase by nearly 50 per cent last year&mdash;595,600 11- to 18-year-olds voted, which is pretty impressive.</p>
    
    <p>So what&rsquo;s gotten into this new generation of well-behaved youngsters? Some experts speculate it&rsquo;s the social sanitizing effect of the Internet, which keeps kids cooped up indoors online instead of out on the street. Others point to the success of public health campaigns, such as those by the alcohol education group Drinkaware. St. James says part of the shift is due to immigration from non-drinking cultures, like Pakistan and Bangladesh. &ldquo;If your parents came from another country where drinking isn&rsquo;t part of the culture, you aren&rsquo;t brought up to do it here,&rdquo; she said. But she adds that her generation&rsquo;s restraint is mostly about economics. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re paying &pound;9,000 a year in tuition and coming out of school with debt, you can&rsquo;t be splashing money everywhere if you don&rsquo;t have it. My generation can&rsquo;t afford to go mad.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>This new and subdued British youth culture isn&rsquo;t good news for everyone. A third of British nightclubs have closed down in the past five years. It&rsquo;s surprising that a generation coming of age in the middle of the greatest recession since the Second World War doesn&rsquo;t feel more entitled to a bit of escapism, but St. James says that&rsquo;s beside the point. &ldquo;The crash and the cuts have affected our generation quite a lot, more than any other. We can either drown our sorrows or we can go out and try to do something about it.&rdquo;

    <hedline>Africa gets  on board</hedline>
    
    
    <p>Forget Boardwalk: players scheming and dealing real estate in the latest version of Monopoly will have their sights set on Banana Island. The man-made island is home to the wealthiest citizens in Lagos, Nigeria, the first African city depicted by the popular board game. In the new Lagos edition, the cheapest property&mdash;Mediterranean Avenue in the original game&mdash;can be found in Makoko, the vast slum built over a lagoon on the edge of the city. &ldquo;The cards have been tailored to the Nigerian peculiarities,&rdquo; says Adeoye Omotayo, spokesperson for the PR company handling the launch. Players might pick a card that sends them to a psychiatric facility for driving the wrong way down a one-way road, he explains, adding that that particular traffic oddity is common in Lagos. </p>
    
    <p>So why base the first African city Monopoly board on Lagos? By some estimates, it is now Africa&rsquo;s largest city. &ldquo;Lagos is a megacity. It is a strong commercial hub for Africa,&rdquo; Omotayo says. And it is the heart of Nigeria&rsquo;s oil-driven economy. The wealth&mdash;and corruption&mdash;generated from oil exports are visible on the new board game, too. A wrong roll of the dice could hand you a card that reads: &ldquo;For attempting to bribe a law enforcement agent, pay a fine.&rdquo;</p>

    <slug>Pakistan</slug>
    
    <hedline>The only female taxi driver</hedline>
    
     <abstract>Zahida Kazmi has survived deadly roads, a fatwa and family abandonment to thrive in her profession</abstract>
     
     
    <p>When it comes to rating her driving skills, on a scale of one to 10, Zahida Kazmi considers herself an 11. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a better driver than most of the men on the road,&rdquo; says the 57-year-old. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I get all the good fares.&rdquo; Kazmi&rsquo;s confidence is the product of two decades of doing what no other woman in Pakistan does: drive a taxi. In such a deeply patriarchal society, surviving so long in an industry run by men&mdash;and in a country notorious for its deadly roads&mdash;is a cause for celebration. </p>
    
    <p>Becoming a taxi driver never frightened her, Kazmi says, sitting upright in her modest house in Rawalpindi, 15 km from Islamabad. &ldquo;I was a widow with six children. They were my only concern. I wanted to give them a good life and a good education. I had a gun and, being a Pashtun, I knew how to use it. Sure, it was tough at first. The male drivers didn&rsquo;t accept me, and the taxi drivers&rsquo; union refused to help. But once they realized I was serious, and they understood the position I was in, they accepted me.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>For the &#64257;rst few months on the job, Kazmi wore a burka. It was a sort of shield she thought would protect her from the lewdness of some men. </p>
    
    <p>But that sort of behaviour never materialized. &ldquo;I took the burka off once I realized that my customers were normal, respectful people,&rdquo; she says. In fact, over two decades of driving, Kazmi has never had to face the kinds of problems female taxi drivers in Canada or the U.S. face: sexual harassment or drunk customers who turn violent. In Pakistan, where alcohol is banned and harassing a woman in public can very easily lead to a sound beating, the immediate dangers are non-existent.</p>
    
    <p>But there are other difficulties, rooted in culture, that have taken their toll on Kazmi. When she first began driving, her family disowned her. More ominously, when word got out that there was a female taxi driver taking to the streets of the Pakistani capital, Abdul Aziz Ghazi, the ultra-conservative Islamabad imam, issued a fatwa against her, calling on Muslims to kill the woman flagrantly breaking the tenets of Islam by being in the presence of male strangers without a chaperone. </p>
    
    <p>Nothing ever happened, however. Kazmi has won the admiration of her fellow drivers, serving as president of the taxi drivers&rsquo; union and chairwoman of the Yellow Cab Association. Even her family has come around. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m famous, they want to have contact with me,&rdquo; she says, smiling wryly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve disowned them.&rdquo;</p>

    <hedline>Banning  Bieber</hedline>
    
    <p>Justin Bieber&rsquo;s rise to stardom is in large part thanks to YouTube. In the Philippines, however, Instagram may prove to be his downfall.</p>
    
    <p>A resolution was filed in the country&rsquo;s congress last month declaring Bieber a &ldquo;<em>persona non grata</em>,&rdquo; barring him from entering the country unless he offers a public apology for taking a few jabs at boxing legend Manny Pacquiao on Instagram, a photo-sharing social network program.</p>
    
    <p>The Filipino icon was knocked out in a recent bout, and images spread across the Internet of him lying motionless on the canvas. Bieber posted a photo of the unconscious boxer with a superimposed picture of Simba from The Lion King, with the words &ldquo;Dad wake up.&rdquo; A second Instagram posting juxtaposed the picture with Michael Jackson doing his dance move. The caption reads: &ldquo;Pacquiao doing the lean with MJ. Classic moment.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Bieber&rsquo;s boxing allegiances are firmly rooted in the corner of American Floyd &ldquo;Money&rdquo; Mayweather Jr., who is the pound-for-pound king of boxing and Pacquiao&rsquo;s rival. </p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is someone as big as Justin Bieber making degrading or insulting comments about a Filipino citizen. Banning him will show how seriously we take our national pride,&rdquo; said Representative Carol Jayne Lopez. She encouraged Filipino youth to stop listening to Bieber&rsquo;s music. There was the Twitter hashtag &ldquo;#banjustinbieber.&rdquo; </p>
    
  
    <p>Bieber responded on Instagram: &ldquo;If they were beliebers I know they wouldn&rsquo;t leave my side over [a] boxing opinion.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Keith Roy began warning his clients about a faltering Vancouver housing market in early 2012. The realtor says he was tipped off not by industry statistics, but by chatter across backyard fences. &ldquo;When you hear about a homeowner who thinks his neighbour got too much money when he sold his house, you know there&rsquo;s something going on,&rdquo; says Roy. &ldquo;That was the first clue.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The next shoe to drop was a handful of homes in desirable west side neighbourhoods that took a few extra days to sell. Sensing a shift in the market, Roy put his own house up for sale in June and penned a blog posting the following month that advised people to &ldquo;cash out.&rdquo; Though he was criticized by fellow agents for breaking rank, Roy says he now feels vindicated after watching Vancouver home sales crumble to their lowest point in more than decade, with prices falling 3.5 per cent since hitting a high last May. The lesson? Recognizing a looming real estate downturn is more art than science; once it shows up in the numbers, it&rsquo;s too late to do much about it. &ldquo;One day the phone just stops ringing,&rdquo; Roy says. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re in it.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s not just Vancouver where realtors&rsquo; BlackBerrys no longer buzz. In Toronto, the city&rsquo;s once insatiable demand for living in 650 sq.-ft. glass boxes has evaporated overnight. Condo sales are down by 30 per cent, while prices have fallen by 4.5 per cent. Some proposed projects have been put on hold, while some angry investors&mdash;like those who bought luxury suites at the Trump International hotel&mdash;are desperate to get their money out, and have turned to the courts. Even the Bank of Canada, which has helped inflate the bubble by tempting Canadians with years of rock-bottom interest rates, has issued a rare warning about the risks posed to the broader housing market of too many condo developers in cities like Toronto and Vancouver chasing too few buyers. </p>
    
    <p>A housing correction&mdash;or, possibly, a crash&mdash;is no longer coming. It&rsquo;s here. And you don&rsquo;t have to own a tiny $500,000 condo in downtown Toronto or a $1.3-million bungalow in Vancouver to get hurt. With few exceptions, the impact will be indiscriminate as the euphoria of rising house prices is replaced by fear. The only question now is how bad things will get. If the decline picks up speed, as many believe it will, there could be a nasty snowball effect. Construction jobs will be lost. Homeowners will end up underwater. Consumers may stop spending. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting very nervous,&rdquo; says David Madani, an economist at Capital Economics, who has been predicting a drop in housing prices of up to 25 per cent in Canada. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a bear, but the housing market itself has the potential to put us in a recession, let alone what&rsquo;s happening in Europe and the U.S.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Canada could be setting itself up for a devastating one-two punch: a painful domestic housing slump just as Canada&rsquo;s export and resource-driven economy is hit with falling global demand. The most acute threat is the U.S. debt crisis, which, if handled poorly, could tip the world&rsquo;s largest economy back into recession, taking Canada along with it. Meanwhile, Europe remains mired in a recession and concerns about China&rsquo;s growth persist. &ldquo;I feel like Canada is in the path of a perfect storm here,&rdquo; Madani says. Other than housing, &ldquo;the key pillar of strength is our booming resource sector,&rdquo; says Madani. &ldquo;If you take that away, it&rsquo;s just going to knock the lights out.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The sudden cooling in Canada&rsquo;s housing sector seemingly struck without warning. As recently as last spring, bidding wars were common in many Canadian cities as were the &ldquo;over asking!&rdquo; stickers agents slapped on &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs. The peak may have been reached in March when one Toronto bungalow made headlines after selling for $1.1 million, more than $420,000 above the list price.</p>
    
    <p>Eight months later, the story has been reversed. And not just in Toronto and Vancouver. In Victoria, existing home sales were down by 22 per cent in November from a year earlier. In Montreal, sales were down 19 per cent last month. Ottawa&rsquo;s sales were down nine per cent and Edmonton&rsquo;s were down six per cent. With all those houses lingering on the market, prices dipped in 10 of 11 big cities across the country between October and November, according to the Teranet-National Bank index. It was the first such drop since 2009.</p>
    
    <p>The weakness is also evident in new home construction. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation reported a third straight month of falling housing starts in November. The trend is expected to continue next year.</p>
    
    <p>With mortgages as cheap as they&rsquo;ve ever been (five-year rates can be had for as little as 2.84 per cent) and no spikes in unemployment, there can only be one explanation: Canadians bid home prices up so high, and piled on so much debt, they&rsquo;ve essentially spooked themselves. In Vancouver, for example, the cost of owning a home eats up more than 80 per cent of an average household&rsquo;s income, according to the Royal Bank&rsquo;s affordability index. In Toronto, it&rsquo;s over 50 per cent. Overall, affordability remains below historical averages across the country, RBC says, with two-storey homes in particular causing &ldquo;affordability-related stress.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Some argue this is exactly what the much hoped-for &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; should look like. Earlier this year, Sherry Cooper, the soon-to-be-retired chief economist at Bank of Montreal, likened the Canadian housing market to a balloon&mdash;not a bubble&mdash;that will deflate slowly and naturally in the absence of a &ldquo;pin.&rdquo; But such semantic distinctions gloss over a key feature of bubbles: psychology. &ldquo;Bubbles inherently contain the seeds of their own undoing,&rdquo; warns Madani. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re driven by overconfidence and expectations that house prices will keep going up. But at some point it just pops.&rdquo; And that creates the spectre of a pendulum that swings the other way.</p>
    
    <p>Nowhere is this mood shift more apparent than in downtown Toronto, where a decade-long condo boom has reshaped the skyline and created a potential glut of tiny, glass-walled suites. There are currently 147 high-rises under construction in Canada&rsquo;s largest city, according to research firm Emporis. That&rsquo;s the most of anywhere in North America, including New York. When completed, an additional 56,336 new living spaces will be added to the city&rsquo;s housing inventory. Most of the projects are conceived and marketed based on a cookie-cutter formula: minimalist decor; &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; amenities ranging from yoga studios to juice bars; and attention-grabbing flourishes, as with one midtown Toronto project called E Condos that promises two towers with &ldquo;cantilevered,&rdquo; glass-walled swimming pools overhanging the streets below. The building boom has even drawn in world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. He was hired by theatre magnate David Mirvish to build three downtown residential towers that will rise as high as 85 floors.</p>
    
    <p>The concern is that the market is being driven by speculators, not families. Many condo purchasers buy off a floor plan&mdash;often borrowing against an existing property&mdash;and then sell or rent their unit once it&rsquo;s completed several years later (units can also be sold, or &ldquo;assigned,&rdquo; to another buyer while a tower is under construction). &ldquo;So far, the demand for units and supply has not been too far out of balance,&rdquo; says Ohad Lederer, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research, citing estimates that investors comprise half of the Toronto condo market. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s reflected by a relatively robust rental market. But I&rsquo;m definitely concerned that, over the next couple of years, an imbalance will emerge.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s happened before. In Miami, a pre-2008 condo boom left 7,000 new units unoccupied after the crash. The upside? College students could suddenly afford to rent swanky suites with granite countertops and ocean views.</p>
    
    <p>Lederer recently sent secret shoppers to several condo sales presentation offices. They made some disturbing discoveries: sales staff who didn&rsquo;t ask for mortgage pre-approvals and who grossly misrepresented the demographic trends&mdash;namely the number of expected new immigrants to Toronto&mdash;that are supposed to keep units in high demand. But Lederer says he is most disturbed by the sector&rsquo;s &ldquo;shoddy mathematics.&rdquo; By his calculations, many condo owners who rent their properties are realizing returns of less than four per cent. If rental rates fall as more units come on the market&mdash;Lederer estimates there are at least 5,000 too many condo units being built in downtown Toronto&mdash;those same investors will soon be losing money, prompting them to sell. &ldquo;Being a landlord is already a negative cash proposition at today&rsquo;s prices,&rdquo; he says, adding that a bust in the condo sector will likely have a &ldquo;trickle up&rdquo; effect by reducing demand for starter homes. </p>
    
    <p>John Andrew, a professor who studies real estate at Queen&rsquo;s University, says Canada&rsquo;s condo boom has put cities like Toronto in uncharted territory. Will all of the tiny suites still be in demand once the novelty of &ldquo;plunge pools&rdquo; and &ldquo;sky bars&rdquo; wears thin? &ldquo;There really isn&rsquo;t a precedent,&rdquo; says Andrew. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve seen market crashes before in Toronto and Vancouver, condos really weren&rsquo;t as prevalent as they are now.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Finance Minister Jim Flaherty decided he had seen enough last July. He dialled back mortgage-amortization periods for government-insured mortgages (required for anyone buying a home with less than a 20 per cent down payment) to 25 years from 30 years, the fourth time he tightened standards in as many years. Observers were quick to note mortgage rules are effectively now back to where they were before the Conservatives took office. A national experiment in lenient lending has finally come to a close. </p>
    
    <p>Even with the market slowing, many experts believe Canada is unlikely to experience a &ldquo;U.S.-style&rdquo; housing crash. The riskiest mortgages are guaranteed by taxpayers through the CMHC, thereby insulating the financial sector from the sort of meltdown endured by Wall Street in 2008. </p>
    
    <p>But a mere collapse in home sales&mdash;and prices&mdash;would be bad enough. Ben Rabidoux, an analyst at M Hanson Advisers, estimates that 1.3 million people, or seven per cent of Canadian workers, are employed in the construction industry, with housing being the main driver. He argued in a recent report that a U.S.-sized housing slowdown could result in the loss of 370,000 jobs and push the unemployment rate well over nine per cent, compared to 7.2 per cent now. And that doesn&rsquo;t include job losses in related industries.</p>
    
    <p>Equally important is the psychological effect that even a moderate slump in home prices will have on consumers. As people watch their net worth crumble&mdash;at least on paper&mdash;they are less likely to spend money on everything from new dishwashers to automobiles. &ldquo;We talk about having a strong housing market because we have a strong economy,&rdquo; Rabidoux says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also true that our economy is strong because we have a strong housing sector.&rdquo; He estimates that as much as 27 per cent of GDP can be linked to Canada&rsquo;s housing market, a disproportionately large number compared to other countries, including the U.S. at its peak. &ldquo;Take it away and that alone puts us into a recession, given where we are,&rdquo; Rabidoux says.</p>
    
    <p>In such a scenario, the homeowners most at risk are those who are overextended. Of the $570 billion in mortgages that the CMHC insures, about half are borrowers with less than 20 per cent equity in their homes. &ldquo;If housing lands hard and affects the broader economy, many people will find themselves effectively underwater at a time when they would most need mobility to pursue employment,&rdquo; Rabidoux says. &ldquo;In this scenario, a house becomes a prison.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s not necessarily condo buyers or those who paid over a million to live in a hot downtown neighbourhood who are most at risk. Rabidoux says people who shelled out for sprawling &ldquo;McMansions&rdquo; in the suburbs could be in particular trouble, as the demand for oversized homes is expected to fall out of favour when baby boomers retire and seek out smaller living spaces closer to the city. Indeed, that&rsquo;s precisely what happened in the U.S., where some estimates peg the number of unwanted &ldquo;large-lot&rdquo; homes at about 40 million across the country. As for smaller houses, Andrew says there remains a shortage of single-family homes in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, which should keep demand relatively high. &ldquo;If you are buying a three- or four-bedroom house right now, then I think you&rsquo;re going to be okay,&rdquo; he says.</p>
    
    <p>Flaherty is still going to have a dilemma on his hands. Falling house prices don&rsquo;t win votes. And there are already calls from the real estate industry to roll back the most recent mortgage rule changes. But most economists agree a correction is both necessary and long overdue. The average debt-to-income ratio of a Canadian household is now 164 per cent, higher than the pre-crash levels in the U.S. A recent survey by BMO found that one-third of Canadians have cut back on spending to make their mortgage payments. Seventeen per cent dipped into savings. </p>
    
    <p>None of it bodes well for the country&rsquo;s ability to absorb another economic shock. When the financial crisis hit, Ottawa responded by buying up $69-billion worth of bank-owned mortgages, encouraging financial institutions to keep lending. After a brief dip, the housing sector bounced back and carried the economy on its shoulders. But today consumers are tapped out just as a new round of macro-threats has emerged. It&rsquo;s widely believed that the U.S.&mdash;and, hence, Canada&mdash;could face another recession unless Republicans and Democrats in Washington are able to agree on a comprehensive deficit-fighting plan. Even if the so-called fiscal cliff (a combination of tax increases and planned spending cuts) is avoided, the U.S. government&rsquo;s longer-term debt troubles could stalk the economy for years to come. At the same time, the European debt crisis and China&rsquo;s faltering growth have created a gloomy global outlook, threatening Canada&rsquo;s large, export-oriented resource sector. With demand for oil falling and increased output from the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota depressing prices, some Canadian energy companies have already cut back on spending, threatening another key economic driver. Suncor, for one, recently said it would review expansion of three major oil sands projects. Talisman Energy is also forecasting spending cuts of as much as 25 per cent next year. The drag is being reflected in GDP. Reduced global demand for oil and gas and manufacturing dragged down the third quarter&rsquo;s anemic 0.6 per cent growth, as did reduced business investment and a drop in exports, according to Statistics Canada. </p>
    
    <p>Bay Street is getting nervous. Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, recently warned Ottawa to &ldquo;be careful what you wish for&rdquo; when it comes to winding down the housing market. He argued in a report that &ldquo;a five per cent per year drop in housing prices, for example, would shed roughly a half-point off GDP growth through its wealth effect on consumer spending.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;That makes it even more urgent that the global economy is healthier come 2014, when the full bite of a housing slump on domestic activity will be felt.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>It all amounts to a dramatic reversal of fortune for Canadians, albeit one we brought on ourselves. Back in 2009, our hot housing market acted as a life preserver in a sea of economic uncertainty. Now it feels more like a cinder block tied around our necks.</p>

  <photo.caption>Play money: Some users worry that moves to regulate Bitcoin will undermine its success</photo.caption>

  <body.content>
  
    <p>Late last year, a radical banking experiment hit a major milestone in Europe, a continent with no shortage of financial drama. It had nothing to do with the euro, however, and everything to do with the &ldquo;currency of the future&rdquo;: Bitcoin. </p>
    
    <p>The digital currency, still widely dismissed by many as Internet play money, gained an unprecedented foothold in the traditional banking world. In December, a Bitcoin currency exchange in France became the first to officially operate within the European financial system. Bitcoin-Central, and its parent company, Paymium, will offer their Bitcoin customers a legitimate French payment account through a partnership with the French financial firm Aqoba. Users will be able to buy euro-priced goods with a debit card attached to that account, and even have their salary paid into it. The account can then be used to buy Bitcoin-priced products online through Bitcoin-Central and, alternatively, trade in Bitcoins for euros. (One Bitcoin is currently worth around $13.) &ldquo;Ever since we started Paymium, what we&rsquo;re trying to do is explain the benefits of the technology to the banking industry,&rdquo; says Paymium co-founder and CEO Pierre Noizat. </p>
    
    <p>Banks and governments may be slow in listening, but there has been a dramatic growth in the number of Bitcoin users and retailers. WordPress, the ubiquitous blogging website, now accepts payment in Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions in 2012 expanded to almost five million through September, more than double the number of transactions for all of 2011 and up from just 219 in 2009. It is now used to buy everything from cupcakes in San Francisco to limo rides in New York. </p>
    
    <p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s big advantage is that it is essentially the cold, hard cash of the Internet. Instead of bills, Bitcoin&rsquo;s software keeps a public ledger of every transaction among users. If a buyer and seller are running the software on their computers, they can directly exchange Bitcoins, anonymously and with no taxes or bank fees. Others can pay a company to process the payment. Bitcoin accounts are listed simply as a string of letters and numbers with no names attached, giving a level of anonymity impossible with debit and credit cards or even PayPal accounts. </p>
    
    <p>Launched in 2008&mdash;the same year the financial crisis struck&mdash;Bitcoin is often described as an antithesis to fiat currencies, set apart for what it does not have: a central bank or any regulating authority. What it does have, however, is a PR problem. Bitcoin is known as a choice currency for illegal drug websites, money laundering and tax evasion. And that&rsquo;s among the minority of people who are even aware it exists. &ldquo;The big challenge right now is people haven&rsquo;t heard about Bitcoin,&rdquo; says Joseph David, the CEO and founder of  VirtEx, a Calgary-based currency exchange that trades Canadian dollars and Bitcoins. He is working to convince Alberta lawmakers of Bitcoin&rsquo;s benefits, hoping for government recognition. &ldquo;This is the revolutionary currency of the future,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;decentralized, not controlled by any government, and no one can shut it down or freeze accounts.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>But the struggle to go mainstream exposes a dilemma at the heart of the Bitcoin movement: the thing that enthusiasts love most about Bitcoin&mdash;its lawlessness&mdash;is the same thing that keeps it on the fringes.  </p>
    
    <p>David and other owners of Bitcoin currency exchanges&mdash;of which there are thousands&mdash;now look to France with envy. Noizat says Bitcoin-Central&rsquo;s deal with Aqoba &ldquo;can help people to adopt Bitcoin as a payment network, and make them more comfortable about using our application.&rdquo; Tony Gallippi, co-founder of BitPay, the company hired by WordPress to process Bitcoin payments, agrees. &ldquo;This is the Netscape moment,&rdquo; he says, referencing the Internet company often credited with popularizing the Internet.  </p>
    
    <p>The Aqoba deal formalizes a relationship that already exists. Bitcoin exchanges hold bank accounts in various currencies, with various financial institutions. The largest exchange, Tokyo-based Mt.Gox, trades US$3 million worth of Bitcoins every day and has an 88 per cent share of the market. It deals in euros, British pounds, U.S., Canadian and Australian dollars, Japanese yen and Polish zloty. Bitcoin buyers make deposits into Mt.Gox&rsquo;s accounts, and are credited with Bitcoins in their digital &ldquo;wallets.&rdquo; But Mt.Gox and others suffer from unpredictable relationships with banks. On Sept. 25, Mt.Gox announced its account with U.K.-based Barclays had been frozen, with no word from the bank as to why. It later told customers Barclays had shut down the account. </p>
    
    <p>Through its new partnership, Bitcoin-Central will be able to offer clients a regulated account, in euros, directly linked to the Bitcoin network and the client&rsquo;s Bitcoin wallet. Because balances held in euros will be protected with the same insurance as regular French bank accounts, the move answers at least one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s ongoing issues: security. Its reputation has suffered from reports of fraud and a string of hacker attacks that saw Bitcoin wallets emptied. </p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;For a while, all of the news stories have been quite negative&mdash;Ponzi schemes, scams, hacking attacks&mdash;and it&rsquo;s always spun in a negative way,&rdquo; says Michael Bliss, owner of a massage therapy company in Vancouver that accepts Bitcoins. &ldquo;It needs to be tested and made stronger from serious attacks,&rdquo; he says, but adds that it also needs time to develop. &ldquo;It took the euro years to get in the disastrous state it is right now. We&rsquo;re in year four of Bitcoin.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>For financial blogger Jon Matonis, that is exactly why he&rsquo;s against Bitcoin companies seeking ties to the banking world. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s premature going toward regulation when Bitcoin is still in beta,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s play money still.&rdquo; Matonis, author of a blog called <em>The Monetary Future</em>, also sits on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group created this year to fund improvements to the Bitcoin software. Regulation and oversight mean less anonymity for Bitcoin&rsquo;s users, he warns&mdash;which is particularly a concern when the majority of payments online are tracked. Besides, he argues, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t need legitimacy, it&rsquo;s already working.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Which is perhaps why the European Central Bank has even bothered to give Bitcoin the once-over. The ECB produced a report in 2012 that suggested policy-makers keep an eye on Bitcoin, in part because of its ideological departure from the kind of economic policy at the heart of all central banks. </p>
    
    <p>If using Bitcoins becomes as easy as using a debit card, the ECB may have reason to worry. The Internet could house, independent of financial regulation and policy-making, its own sprawling economy. &ldquo;They can ignore it, and they can fight it,&rdquo; says Paymium&rsquo;s Pierre Noizat of the banking establishment, &ldquo;but it will keep going.&rdquo;</p>

    <abstract>Military drones are finding new uses: keeping track of cattle and, perhaps one day, delivering the mail</abstract>

  <body.content>
    <p>A fledgling company in southern Alberta is sending drone technology originally designed for the military into the sky to take pictures of sugar beets, potatoes and even cattle in an effort to help farmers better manage their crops and livestock. The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used by Lethbridge-based Isis Geomatics can fit in a backpack when disassembled and, when launched, use cameras to tag each part of a field with an exact location. A farmer can then scan the images to determine where to apply water or fertilizer or keep track of cattle.</p>
    
    <p>Agriculture is just one emerging commercial application for UAVs. Drones, such as those manufactured at Waterloo, Ont.-based Aeryon Labs, are becoming easy enough for anyone to operate; they&rsquo;ve been used so far for wildlife surveys and to map shipping routes. Isis hopes to add oil- and gas-field surveying to its services. Other firms are planning to use drones as super-efficient couriers in remote areas. &ldquo;People are recognizing the opportunities,&rdquo; says Aeryon Labs&rsquo; vice-president of marketing, Ian McDonald.</p>
    
    <p>In agricultural applications, the drones are part of a trend toward precision agriculture: using technology to reduce costs and maximize yields. The UAVs that Isis employs are a huge improvement on the field surveys CEO Steve Myshak used while studying geography at the University of Lethbridge. Some of the methods &ldquo;were pretty archaic&mdash;using boom trucks and scaffolding and cranes,&rdquo; he says. Myshak partnered with classmate Owen Brown to launch Isis in June. </p>
    
    <p>Business has been better than expected, but there are challenges&mdash;among them the high cost of UAVs. An Aeryon Scout, the type Isis uses, is $60,000, making UAVs cost-effective for high-value crops only. In southern Alberta, this means sugar beets, potatoes and seed canola. &ldquo;As it gets cheaper and some of the farmers adopt the technology, it will be more common,&rdquo; says Myshak. &ldquo;Right now, the price point is so high and the technology is so new that they don&rsquo;t really understand how it can help them.&rdquo; Aeryon&rsquo;s McDonald expects to see more service providers like Isis enter the market before farmers buy their own drones. </p>
    
    <p>Users also need permits from Transport Canada, and there are restrictions on flights. In the U.S., regulations are even tighter. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) only grants permits for UAVs to colleges, but some American entrepreneurs see the potential and are partnering with public agencies to test their designs. Young Kim, general manager of Bosh Precision Agriculture in Virginia, hopes UAVs will be approved for civil applications in 2015, with police and firefighters getting initial permits. Agriculture could follow, he hopes, mainly because it doesn&rsquo;t face the safety and privacy concerns present in urban centres. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all out in rural areas and we&rsquo;re going to be flying over flat terrain without a lot of man-made obstacles,&rdquo; he says.</p>
    
    <p>Once the technology is approved, the possibilities are endless. Two U.S. companies are currently testing technology to create a &ldquo;matternet,&rdquo; a kind of physical Internet that would use UAVs to quickly deliver small packages such as urgent medications or blood test results between various points. Such a system could be used in remote areas, or in developing countries with poor infrastructure. But those applications are years away and, until the FAA loosens its regulations, American UAV entrepreneurs are stuck in a holding pattern.</p>

  <photo.caption>On the rise: AirWatch opened a new headquarters to house its expanding workforce</photo.caption>
    
  <photo.byline>ANDREW HNATH</photo.byline>
    
  <body.content>
    <p>In the mobile tech trade, a business built on communication, rescinding a party invite is one way to send a frosty message. So when John Marshall, CEO of the Atlanta-based software firm AirWatch LLC, learned that Research In Motion Ltd. had &ldquo;disinvited&rdquo; him and six executives from the BlackBerry World expo last spring&mdash;a week before the May 1 conference, and with their Orlando flights and hotels already booked&mdash;the snub was obvious. </p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re seen as a direct competitor,&rdquo; Marshall says. RIM refunded the airline tickets. AirWatch, a &ldquo;Bronze sponsor&rdquo; since BlackBerry World in 2011, yanked its funding from the 2012 conference. The BlackBerry maker&rsquo;s hostility toward the little-known southern start-up was telling. Theirs is a see-saw relationship. When big organizations dump RIM&rsquo;s BlackBerry Enterprise Server&mdash;the once-pioneering software for handling workers&rsquo; emails&mdash;they contract AirWatch to protect the data on mobile devices like iPhones and Android phones. Consumer choice is driving the migration, says Jefferies analyst Peter Misek, who tracks RIM. &ldquo;As RIM&rsquo;s fortunes have faded, these alternative smartphone platforms have risen.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Long a stalwart of corporate networks, the BlackBerry Enterprise Server was for years touted for its encryption guarantees. The rub was that the platform was tethered exclusively to RIM products. Market research firm IDC forecast recently that the number of Apple iPhones and Google Android handsets for enterprise consumers this year will overtake the number of BlackBerry units shipped to employees for the first time ever. </p>
    
    <p>AirWatch is suddenly and quickly eroding RIM&rsquo;s bread-and-butter business. Yahoo! and the Pentagon recently ditched the BlackBerry server so they could put non-RIM products into employees&rsquo; hands. Coca-Cola, Lowe&rsquo;s, the National Bank of Canada, eight of the top 10 U.S. retailers and several U.S. federal agencies already use AirWatch. With 4,500 customers in 47 countries, it is king among just a handful of mobile device management (MDM) vendors&mdash;companies in the hot market of securing data on office-issued devices. &ldquo;If [a company] has more than 20,000 devices in the enterprise, that&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; says Victor Cooper, an AirWatch spokesperson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re 99 per cent sure of that.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>The AirWatch platform puts various restrictions on employee smartphones and can add custom capabilities like encryption for email attachments. Among its four serious industry competitors&mdash;MobileIron, Fiberlink Communications, Zenprise and Good Technology Inc.&mdash;AirWatch stands out for its staggering growth. It has ballooned to 900 workers from 350 in the past 19 months. A new 100,000-sq.-foot headquarters in north Atlanta is nearly triple the size of its old office. Stock tickers overlook a cavernous trade floor&mdash;relics from the building&rsquo;s days as an energy company. It has global offices in London, Melbourne and Bangalore, and a Canadian presence is planned for Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal. </p>
    
    <p>AirWatch signs 500 customers a month, an estimated 80 per cent of which are enterprises letting staff use Android, iOS, Samsung and Windows smartphones. Unlike RIM&rsquo;s BlackBerry-dedicated server, AirWatch supports all principal mobile players, RIM devices included. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unfair to say that due to some unfortunate events at our favourite Ontario-based smartphone maker, it&rsquo;s certainly had a positive effect on our business,&rdquo; Cooper says. </p>
    
    <p>Dan Gifford, a former app developer for RIM in Atlanta, interviewed at AirWatch amid layoffs at RIM last July. He met twice with a recruiter before deciding to start his own  web development venture. The BlackBerry server&rsquo;s weakness, Gifford says, is its lack of support for most next-generation toys. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to move away from BlackBerry, there&rsquo;s no question you&rsquo;d just go with the AirWatch server.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>RIM isn&rsquo;t ignoring today&rsquo;s &ldquo;more heterogeneous mobile market,&rdquo; says Peter Devenyi, RIM&rsquo;s senior vice-president for enterprise software. The BlackBerry Enterprise Server 10, which will debut Jan. 30 along with the new BlackBerry 10 smartphones, is a cross-platform solution &ldquo;extended to support all devices.&rdquo; Devenyi is also excited about a feature that is unique to BlackBerry 10 devices: the option to let users toggle between &ldquo;work mode&rdquo; and &ldquo;personal mode,&rdquo; which will clear corporate apps and sensitive data. &ldquo;The beauty of it is the fact that it&rsquo;s one phone which seamlessly separates your personal space from your workspace,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;like two phones integrated into one.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>To AirWatch&rsquo;s CEO, though, it&rsquo;s late to play catch-up in the MDM game. Marshall knows AirWatch and its competitors wouldn&rsquo;t have been relevant had RIM offered a cross-platform solution first. Customers &ldquo;won&rsquo;t jump from our platforms to return to RIM,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to put the genie back in the bottle.&rdquo;     </p>

    <abstract>Sales of big pickups are booming as automakers try to clear dealer lots for newer, more efficient models</abstract>

  <body.content>
    <p>North America might appear to be entering the age of electric and hybrid cars, but there is no doubt who the king of the road still is: the big, reliable pickup truck. In Canada, Ford&rsquo;s line of pickup trucks, the F-series, is the bestselling vehicle, and the company recently announced it sold a record 100,000 trucks in the country in 2012. Other automakers, such as General Motors, are hoping for similar numbers as they introduce new versions of their pickups at a time when the industry is finally firing on all cylinders again.</p>
    
    <p>Pickup truck sales reached their lowest point in a decade just after the 2008 auto crisis left heavyweights such as GM and Chrysler bankrupt, and the financial crisis left consumers&rsquo; wallets empty. Five years later, as businesses and individuals are feeling more confident, many are looking to resume spending on what they see as a practical and necessary investment. &ldquo;Pickup trucks are part of our culture,&rdquo; says Howard Elmer, a senior writer at <em>Sympatico Autos</em>. &ldquo;They play to self-reliance and the fact there are more and more entrepreneurs and small businesses.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The average American vehicle is 11 years old. Having delayed new purchases for several years, consumers are now looking to upgrade. Yet despite the prevalence of smaller models with hybrid engines, demand for full-size pickups jumped 16 per cent in August. Part of the reason is that newer vehicles, while no smaller, are more efficient. GM just unveiled a 2014 model with eco-friendly engines, and Ford&rsquo;s 2014 model will reportedly be made of aluminum so the body is lighter.</p>
    
    <p>Competition between automakers is at an all-time high, with many offering deep discounts&mdash;as much as $5,000 on older models&mdash;to make room for the new pickups coming this year. (GM is launching new versions of both its Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra truck.) But if you think pickups are the new minivans, rest assured the urban cowboy spirit lives on. &ldquo;Did I need a truck I could beat down punks in sports cars in?&rdquo; said one Toyota truck fan on the <em>Tundra Headquarters</em>blog. &ldquo;No . . . BUT DANG IS IT FUN.&rdquo;</p>

    <hedline>America&rsquo;s  magic number</hedline>
    
    <p>Last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would keep borrowing costs at rock bottom until unemployment drops to 6.5 per cent, provided inflation doesn&rsquo;t rise past 2.5 per cent. It was a revolutionary statement. America&rsquo;s monetary policy is now explicitly tied to the jobless rate, rather than just price levels. The Fed was administering the U.S. economy the equivalent of &ldquo;a new drug that is yet to go through clinical testing,&rdquo; wrote Mohamed El-Erian, the CEO of PIMCO, which runs the world&rsquo;s largest bond fund.</p>
    
    <p>The move raises a tough question: how long will it take to reach 6.5 per cent unemployment? It could happen as early as next year or as late as 2018, according to Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney at the Brookings Institution, a think tank based in Washington. Some observers are asking what Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will do if the jobless rate falls simply because more Americans give up looking for jobs, thus taking themselves out of the unemployment head count.</p>
    
    <p>There&rsquo;s also the question of the immediate health of the U.S. economy as it struggles with trillion-dollar deficits and debt ceilings that could send it back into recession this year. In the worst-case scenario, unemployment would climb back to nine per cent, up from 7.9 per cent now, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That would push a 6.5 per cent unemployment scenario even further into the future.</p>
    
    <p>If it means many more years of near-zero interest rates, Bernanke&rsquo;s medicine will have significant potential side effects. Such low-for-long rates discourage savings, hurt fixed-income investors like pension funds and insurance companies, and potentially invite very risky bets as people look for decent returns for their cash, says Beata Caranci, vice-president and deputy chief economist at TD Bank Financial Group.</p>
    
    <p>Low rates south of the border would also constrain Canada&rsquo;s ability to raise its own borrowing costs, something that Caranci says is essential in order to ensure that record levels of household debt don&rsquo;t continue to grow. As long as borrowing costs next to nothing, people will take on more debt, she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just economics.&rdquo;</p>

    <hedline>Who really runs Netflix?</hedline>
    
    <p>Amazon isn&rsquo;t just the world&rsquo;s biggest online retailer, one of its fastest-growing businesses lately is managing web storage for major online firms like Netflix. A lot of Netflix customers found that out the hard way on Christmas Eve, when Amazon Web Services (AWS) crashed, blacking out Netflix service for millions of Canadians and Americans at a peak time. Only a few weeks earlier, Netflix&rsquo;s CEO Reed Hastings said he hoped to have Netflix entirely hosted on Amazon by the end of next year. Despite the glitch, he has made no move to end the relationship, and Amazon&rsquo;s revenue from AWS&mdash;which, according to analysts, could soon be as much as $3 billion a year&mdash;seems safe. But people did notice that Amazon&rsquo;s own rival service, Amazon Prime, was unaffected by the outage. Maybe it&rsquo;s not a great idea to allow your biggest competitor to have so much power over your business.</p>

    <hedline>The fuel of  the future</hedline>
    
    <p>Sasol, a fuel company based in South Africa, recently announced plans to invest up to $14 billion in a facility in Louisiana that will turn natural gas to diesel fuel, a bold&mdash;not to mention incredibly costly&mdash;project that represents one of the biggest foreign investments ever in the U.S. It&rsquo;s not the only company eyeing the growing North American gas market. Shell is working with partner companies to develop bigger engines able to run on liquefied natural gas. In Canada, Calgary-based Encana Corp. recently closed a $2.2-billion deal with PetroChina to develop natural gas projects.</p>
    
    <p>Increasingly, energy companies are betting natural gas will be North America&rsquo;s future fuel as plentiful shale gas reserves are uncovered. Canada&rsquo;s natural gas sector is on course to rival the oil sands, attracting up to $386 billion in investment, adding nearly $1 trillion to the economy and supporting about 131,000 jobs annually over the next 24 years, according to a Conference Board of Canada report. (The oil patch is expected to generate $364 billion in investments.) One U.S. estimate said shale gas development in the U.S. would create 870,000 jobs by 2015. Analysts say the one big threat to the industry now is too much of a good thing: a glut of gas pushing down prices.</p>

    <hedline>Housing, take two</hedline>
    
    <p>Who&rsquo;s placing the biggest bet on the comeback of the U.S. housing market? Not Wall Street, but cable TV channels that run home-buying shows with titles like <em>Love It or List It</em>. The crash of 2008 wiped out a lot of reality shows about purchasing expensive homes; instead, channels like Home and Garden Television and the Learning Channel (TLC) shifted toward shows like <em>The Unsellables</em>, about people whose homes had become worthless. Now, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, these networks are working on a new cycle of housing shows, though like many cautious owners, they&rsquo;re starting with cheap homes: HGTV&rsquo;s future projects include <em>Power Broker</em> and <em>Fixer Upper</em>, about helping young buyers improve their first houses, and TLC is bringing back the show <em>My First Home</em> after a three-year break. Network executives had better hope they&rsquo;re right about the market. If not, the only people in bigger trouble will be those who actually bought the houses.</p>

  <body.content>
    <p>On Sept. 24, 2007, a Monday evening, Cathleen Renner sat down in her home office to tackle a project. Renner, 47, was a manager at AT&amp;T, where she&rsquo;d been for 25 years. It isn&rsquo;t clear how many hours she spent at the computer that night, making a plan for a possible employee strike, but she did send an email to a colleague at 12:26 a.m. When her son got up at 7 a.m., she was at her desk. Renner took him to the bus a little later, and as she walked out the door, she clutched her leg and let out a cry of pain. Still, she returned to work. At 11:34, she called an ambulance. Renner was dead by the time she reached the hospital.  </p>
    
    <p>Like most of us, Renner spent long hours on the job seated at her computer; in a workers&rsquo; compensation claim filed after her death, her husband argued that sitting was what killed her. (Renner died of a pulmonary embolism after a blood clot formed in her leg.) The case was not exactly straightforward; AT&amp;T called an expert who pointed out Renner was morbidly obese, weighing 304 lb., and had recently started taking new medication, birth control pills. But in 2011 a New Jersey judge ruled in James Renner&rsquo;s favour, noting his wife&rsquo;s job required her to &ldquo;spend unusually long hours at her computer&rdquo; and awarding him workers&rsquo; compensation benefits as a result. The decision was extremely unusual, the first of its kind legal observers could recall. But if a growing number of health experts are right about the dangers of sitting, it could be a harbinger of things to come. </p>
    
    <p>Like obesity or smoking before it, sitting is the new plague, and not just because it can lead to deadly blood clots. Alarmingly, the latest research links it to obesity, diabetes and the major killers, heart disease and cancer. And exercising the recommended half-hour a day, while beneficial, isn&rsquo;t enough to stave off the ill effects of sitting. &ldquo;Thirty minutes is two per cent of your day,&rdquo; says Mark Tremblay, director of the Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research Group (HALO) at the CHEO Research Institute in Ottawa. &ldquo;What about the other 98 per cent?&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>The latest and most powerful warning comes from a team at the University of Leicester and Loughborough University in England.In a meta-analysis of 18 studies (which included almost 800,000 participants), they found that sitting for long periods increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and death. And, as Tremblay suggested, sitting was shown to be a risk independent of exercise&mdash;meaning that a person who regularly visits the gym is still in danger if he or she is inactive for most of the rest of the day.  </p>
    
    <p>Sedentary behaviour&mdash;sitting at work, watching TV, commuting&mdash;now eats up the vast majority of our time. In another study, Australian researchers looked at TV watching specifically. &ldquo;TV viewing time may have adverse health consequences that rival those of lack of physical activity, obesity and smoking,&rdquo; it stated<em>.</em> &ldquo;Every single hour of TV viewed may shorten life by as much as 22 minutes.&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>Of course, those who aren&rsquo;t watching TV are likely sitting with an iPad, a computer, a video game or a book. We sit at the office, at home, in the car. We sit for work, and to relax. The difference between all these types of sedentary behaviour isn&rsquo;t understood, and we can&rsquo;t say how much is too much. &ldquo;Not a lot of people study the health consequences of reading, and we need to,&rdquo; says Tremblay. In 2011, his group launched the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network (SBRN) to focus on the health impacts of sitting. It is the first and only group of its kind in the world. We&rsquo;re just beginning to understand the sitting disease, but what we already know suggests that modern society is making us quite sick.</p>
    
 
    
    <p>Even as a child, Dr. James Levine wondered why some people seem destined to be fat, whereas others can eat as much as they like and stay thin. Now an obesity researcher, he&rsquo;s spent decades looking into it. In a 1999 study, he fed test subjects an extra 1,000 calories a day on top of what they needed to maintain their current weight. Some gained almost nothing; others packed on 10 times as much. In 2005, Levine, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., followed up with a twist: his subjects wore a pair of &ldquo;magic underwear&rdquo; he&rsquo;d designed, interlaced with sensors to track every movement.  </p>
    
    <p>As Levine meticulously monitored caloric input and output, it became clear that those who stayed thin were moving around more, but they weren&rsquo;t devoting more time to formal exercise. Instead, they were unconsciously making little movements throughout the day, burning off the extra calories. They were also spending two hours less per day in a chair, compared with peers who gained weight. Years later, the fact that sedentariness is linked to obesity, independently of exercise, still surprises. &ldquo;I just came from giving a talk at a sports centre,&rdquo; Levine says. &ldquo;I thought people were going to throw their frozen yogourts at me.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>The most cutting-edge research shows that if people sit too much, they&rsquo;re at increased risk of cancer, according to Christine Friedenreich, a University of Calgary cancer epidemiologist. A 2010 literature review in <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention</em> found that sitting was associated with a higher risk of colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancer, as well as cancer mortality in women. Sedentary people are more likely to have metabolic syndrome (a cluster of symptoms like high blood pressure, insulin resistance and extra fat packed around the abdomen), which is associated with heart disease and some types of cancer.  </p>
    
    <p>The human body is built for movement, not for sitting still. &ldquo;The leg muscles are the largest in the body, in terms of skeletal muscle,&rdquo; says Peter Katzmarzyk, a professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.. &ldquo;When you sit, you&rsquo;re deactivating them.&rdquo; After a little under an hour, our metabolism starts to go to sleep. The body becomes less adept at vacuuming sugar and fat from the bloodstream, causing them to build up and insulin levels to spike. The human system is like a Ferrari, Levine says. &ldquo;If you leave it to idle, it clogs up.&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>It takes a surprisingly short time even for early signs of muscle wasting to occur. In a 2010 study, a team of U.S. researchers recruited subjects to wear a platform shoe on one foot for 48 hours, preventing one leg from touching the ground. &ldquo;We had them wear accelerometers so we could monitor their movements,&rdquo; says lead author Kimberly Reich, an assistant professor at High Point University in North Carolina. &ldquo;Honestly, they were just couch potatoes all weekend. We instructed them to relax, but when they needed to move, they had to use crutches.&rdquo; Taking a muscle biopsy 24 hours after the shoe was off, they saw changes in gene expression that could lead to muscle wasting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d hypothesized that when they started walking again, everything would be back to normal,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; (The team didn&rsquo;t collect biopsies more than 24 hours after, so we don&rsquo;t know if or when these changes were reversed.) </p>
    
    <p>Before scientists started to chart the effects of too much sitting, sedentariness was treated as a neutral factor&mdash;shorthand for the absence of exercise. This was in spite of the fact that earlier research had hinted sedentariness could be dangerous: in the 1950s a study in The <em>Lancet</em> noted that London bus drivers had double the risk of heart attack compared to bus conductors, who walked around taking tickets. That&rsquo;s changing. &ldquo;<em>Too much sitting</em> now may be seen as distinct from <em>too little exercise</em>,&rdquo; stated a 2012 paper from Neville Owen of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Australia, published in the journal <em>Preventive Medicine</em>. In just the past few years, sitting has emerged as its own powerful risk factor. </p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s a new way of thinking. We still don&rsquo;t have an across-the-board definition of what &ldquo;sedentary behaviour&rdquo; means. The research network has called for a standard definition that would classify it as a waking behaviour done in a sitting or reclining posture which has an energy expenditure less than or equal to 1.5 metabolic equivalents, or METs, a measure of the energy demand of movement. (One MET is resting, and brisk walking or running might account for three to eight METs.) Sleep doesn&rsquo;t qualify; it&rsquo;s a restorative state and, unlike when we&rsquo;re sitting, we don&rsquo;t tend to snack while we sleep. Still, even on the question of sleep there is disagreement. &ldquo;Picture your great-grandfather doing chores. He needed to rest so his muscles could rebuild,&rdquo; says Tremblay. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s world is different. The need to repair and regenerate is not really there.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Of all the types of sedentary behaviour, TV watching seems to be the worst, Tremblay says, &ldquo;worse than playing a board game or working on a computer.&rdquo; He compares it to hibernation: &ldquo;Your metabolic rate almost goes below resting.&rdquo; When tapping away at a computer, for example, we&rsquo;re a bit busier, more alert. &ldquo;You may be less likely to be nibbling on something, whereas if you&rsquo;re watching TV, you might be snacking,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re exposed to commercials that prompt you to eat, smoke or drink.&rdquo;  </p>
    
    <p>The Australian study wasn&rsquo;t the only one to highlight the dangers of TV. Another, published in the online medical journal <em>BMJ Open</em> in July, found that the U.S. population could gain an estimated two years of life expectancy by reducing sitting to less than three hours a day, and gain 1.38 years from reducing television watching to less than two hours a day. A 2011 review of studies, in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, estimated that among 100,000 Americans per year, each two-hour increment of TV watching per day was associated with 176 new cases of Type 2 diabetes, 38 new cases of fatal cardiovascular disease and 104 newcases of all-cause mortality.  </p>
    
    <p>But TV watching is also the most widely studied form of sedentary activity, partly because people tend to have a good sense of how much television they watch. It can be harder to recall how much time was spent sitting at a desk or in a car. </p>
    
    <p>It will be years before we untangle it all, but for now a consensus is growing: too much sitting is deadly, no matter what kind. A recent series of articles in <em>The</em> <em>Lancet</em> went so far as to call physical inactivity a global pandemic. &ldquo;Of the 36 million deaths each year from non-communicable diseases,&rdquo; a commentary states, &ldquo;physical inactivity and smoking each contribute about five million.&rdquo; </p>
    
 
    
    <p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve instituted more and more sitting time into our lives. In 1970, two in 10 working Americans were at jobs that required light activity, like sitting at a desk; three in 10 were in high-activity jobs, like construction or farming. By 2000, more than four in 10 were in desk jobs, and only two in 10 were in high-activity jobs, said a 2010 commentary in <em>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</em>. We also spend longer hours at the office. Screen time has increased dramatically, the same report noted, and other contributors to daily sitting time, like hours spent watching TV and driving, are at all-time highs. Between 1989 and 2009, the number of households with a computer and Internet access jumped from 15 per cent to 69 per cent. Screens are ubiquitous. Almost one-third of U.S. children under age 2 have a television in their bedrooms, notes a 2011 study from the non-profit Common Sense Media. </p>
    
    <p>Some companies are finding ways to build activity into their employees&rsquo; work hours. Researchers at CHEO, home of Sedentary Behaviour Research Network, take walking meetings; if the group&rsquo;s too big, they&rsquo;ll book a room and stand. At the San Francisco headquarters of Square Inc., a mobile payment app, &ldquo;a lot of our engineers and designers are at stand-up tables,&rdquo; CEO Jack Dorsey tells <em>Maclean&rsquo;s</em>. Dorsey, who also co-created Twitter, notes that Ernest Hemingway worked at a stand-up desk. (Not just Hemingway&mdash;Leonardo da Vinci, Ben Franklin and other great minds famously worked standing up.) &ldquo;I feel more creative on my feet,&rdquo; he says. Standing desks are used at Google, AOL and Facebook.  </p>
    
    <p>Sensing a new market, office-supply companies are swooping in. Ergo Desktop, which sells adjustable-height desks, was launched in 2009. Back then, the company was &ldquo;just myself and my wife&rsquo;s encouragement,&rdquo; says Dan Sharkey. Today, the Ohio-based business employs 16 people, sells $3-million worth of desks a year and attracts clients like ESPN, Harvard University and NASA. Steelcase, another office supplier, worked with Levine to develop a desk mounted on a low-speed treadmill so employees can walk and work (it sells for upwards of $5,000). Levine also developed the Gruve device, a personal activity monitor that vibrates if its wearer has been sitting too long. Australian inventors have created something called an &ldquo;alarming cushion,&rdquo; which works on the same principle.  </p>
    
    <p>But overhauling a culture centred on sitting is easier said than done. Standing at a meeting can give the impression of restlessness or inattention. Walking at a treadmill desk while typing is an acquired skill. And standing all day isn&rsquo;t really healthy, either; not long ago, when more jobs were in fields like manufacturing, the workplace plague was standing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fatiguing,&rdquo; says Alan Hedge, director of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University. Standing can also lead to its own health problems, like varicose veins.  </p>
    
    <p>Hedge has an electric desk that raises and lowers with the touch of a button&mdash;but he never stands to use it. It&rsquo;s too much of a bother. &ldquo;When I raise it, I have to change the position of the screen on the computer and move things around, and I&rsquo;m just not going to do that,&rdquo; he says. Fancy equipment or not, like Hedge, plenty of people would simply rather work sitting down. Cutting back on sitting time at home is equally troublesome. It seems we&rsquo;d rather watch others exercise on <em>The Biggest Loser</em> than work out ourselves. </p>
    
    <p>We still don&rsquo;t definitively know the best way to prevent the sitting disease. Of the research that&rsquo;s been done, one thing does seem powerfully effective: breaking up sedentary time. A 2012 study in <em>Diabetes Care</em> from a team including Neville Owen found that overweight or obese adults who interrupted their sitting time every 20 minutes with two-minute walks had healthier glucose and insulin levels in their blood.  </p>
    
    <p>It could be that we&rsquo;ll see recommendations from the World Health Organization and others on breaking up or reducing sitting time, like the ones that already push people to exercise. In Canada, it&rsquo;s already started: the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology has released &ldquo;sedentary behaviour guidelines&rdquo; to warn kids off more than two hours of recreational screen time per day, and guidelines for adults will follow. In Denmark, according to a report in Bloomberg <em>Businessweek</em>, employers are required by law to provide adjustable-height desks for their employees.  </p>
    
    <p>We could see mandated walking breaks for office workers, and more workers&rsquo; compensation claims. The floodgates could soon be open to legal claims similar to Cathleen Renner&rsquo;s. Perhaps with an eye on that possibility, AT&amp;T has appealed the Renner decision, according to Patrick Caulfield, James Renner&rsquo;s lawyer; the case will be heard by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. </p>
    
    <p>For the millions of us who are mostly sedentary, though, change would have to happen at a societal level&mdash;everything from the workplace to the commute to home life would be affected. It would be a monumental task, but observers insist there is precedent. After all, indoor smoking today is an anachronism; eventually, maybe spending long stretches seated in a chair will be, too. &ldquo;If we said to people 20 years ago, &lsquo;There will be a smoking ban,&rsquo; they would have been shocked,&rdquo; says Emma Wilmot of the University of Leicester, lead author of the meta-analysis. &ldquo;Now, we accept it.&rdquo;</p>

  <photo.caption>Competition for water: The Mennonite community prospered in Mexico, until the wells ran dry</photo.caption>
    
  <photo.byline>Gael Gonzalez/Reuters</photo.byline>
    
  <body.content>
  
    <p>Peter Friesen talks as if he&rsquo;s seen the promised land. A Mennonite farmer and father of 13 in Mexico&rsquo;s northern Chihuahua state, his blue eyes brighten as he paints a picture of a place with pleasant people, raging rivers and vast tracts of virgin land ideal for agriculture. &ldquo;We saw really good land with lots of water,&rdquo; Friesen recalled, while seated in the booth of a Mennonite pizzeria that sells pies smothered with the prized local product, a tangy cheese known as <em>queso menonita</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Friesen isn&rsquo;t talking about paradise. He&rsquo;s talking about Russia, where his Mennonite ancestors once worked the land before departing for the Canadian Prairies and then the high plains of northern Mexico. Friesen and 10 Mennonites recently travelled to Russia to explore a possible relocation from Chihuahua to the prairie of Tatarstan&mdash;900 km east of Moscow and similar to Manitoba with its cold winters, hot summers and flat prairie. The possible relocation is not a nostalgic return to his roots, but rather a resolution for the most pressing problems Mexican Mennonites face: shortages of land and water. &ldquo;We could cultivate 10 times more than we have here,&rdquo; says Enrique Voth Penner, who also went to Russia.</p>
    
    <p>For the Mexican Mennonites, an estimated 50,000 of whom are eligible for Canadian passports, land is scarce&mdash;a problem for a people with large broods and a fondness for farming. Previous generations of Mennonites pushed into the Chihuahua desert from their original settlements (including the aptly named Colonia Manitoba), drilling wells as they went. But times have changed. What land remains lacks adequate water to coax crops such as corn and wheat from the region&rsquo;s sandy soils. Wells now are being drilled to depths of more than 500 m and the National Water Commission has stopped issuing permits. Making matters worse, Mexico just experienced its worst drought in 71 years. Water problems &ldquo;have given people a push, given them a reason to migrate,&rdquo; Voth says.</p>
    
    <p>The Mennonites now &#64257;nd themselves embroiled in an escalating water war, in which they&rsquo;ve landed on the wrong side of public opinion and, in some cases, allegedly participated in acts of corruption&mdash;namely paying bribes for permits and drilling wells without permission. The competition for water is fierce&mdash;so fierce that stories have surfaced linking some Mennonites to organized crime, without offering proof. In October, the leader of a farm group crusading against illegal wells turned up dead. &ldquo;There are people who are envious,&rdquo; says Mennonite tour guide Abraham Peters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time that we explore other options.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>In Russia, Voth found plenty to like: land, water, low taxes and offers of credit. Voth figures 100 families would go, but says the Mennonites, who are pacificsts, still need a guaranteed exemption from military service. </p>
    
    <p>A move would only be the latest for a wandering people; some 6,000 Mennonites relocated to Mexico in the 1920s to escape rules in Manitoba mandating English-only education. The Mexican government promised the Mennonites the right to run religious schools&mdash;in complete violation of the country&rsquo;s constitution, which mandates secular education&mdash;and an ability to avoid obligatory military service. The Mexican government has kept its end of the bargain, the Mennonites say, although many from traditional colonies, who still use horses and buggies, moved to Bolivia in 1967 after electricity came to Mexico. Others left during the worst of the drug war, which hit Chihuahua and Durango states especially hard. &ldquo;There are always people that don&rsquo;t think they can make it here and leave,&rdquo; says septuagenarian farmer Guillermo Thiessen. </p>
    
    <p>The community has prospered, as the Mennonites brought agriculture to inhospitable parts of Mexico, and developed a commercial corridor in Colonia Manitoba that attracts buyers from across the country in search of farm and irrigation equipment. Still, they stayed somewhat separate from the broader Mexican society. The Mennonites still speak Low German, attend their own schools&mdash;and are best known for <em>queso menonita</em> and the blond vendors in plaid shirts and coveralls who sell it at intersections.</p>
    
    <p>Thiessen says he feels both Mexican and Mennonite and has grandchildren who married Mexicans. He inadvertently shows many Mexican traits, such as saying, &ldquo;<em>Gracias a D&iacute;os</em>,&rdquo; (thanks to God) when asked how he&rsquo;s doing, professing a preference for spicy food and going abroad for short-term employment excursions. He recently made $3,000 picking potatoes in Winkler, Man. But Thiessen says he&rsquo;s too old to relocate to Russia. Friesen is also more interested in Russia for his children than for himself, but he expects a warm welcome, should they ever arrive. &ldquo;The officials told us in the &#64257;rst meeting, &lsquo;Welcome  home.&rsquo; &rdquo;    </p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s after midnight in New York, in an alley in Chelsea, where homeless men sleep on window ledges and garbage trucks collect trash by moonlight. In a brick office building, up a rickety elevator to the eighth floor, a hundred hipsters, every one styled with ironic hats and oversized scarves and stilettos, laugh and mingle in low lighting. Beer bottles and half-eaten pizzas are strewn on every table, though no one eats or drinks the props.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Rolling, rolling!&rdquo; calls a cameraman, and in struts Marnie, played by the impossibly beautiful Allison Williams, in a peacock-blue dress. Hunched behind the camera, in sensible heels and a too-short lace dress that reveals the Spanx beneath it, is 26-year-old Lena Dunham, creator, writer, producer and sometimes-director of the HBO comedy,<em>&nbsp;Girls</em>. Once she&rsquo;s happy with the party scene, Dunham calls &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; and releases the extras for lunch&mdash;at 1 a.m. Then she comes over to apologize.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re shooting a boring establishment shot, but we&rsquo;ll try to keep it spicy for you,&rdquo; she jokes, bursting with friendly energy even though she doesn&rsquo;t drink coffee. &ldquo;I love nights, I thrive on them. My natural rhythm would be sleeping from 4 a.m. to noon.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Sleeping till noon&mdash;like begging your parents for rent money, letting your friend give you a freestyle tattoo, or eating cupcakes in your bathtub&mdash;is part of Dunham&rsquo;s love-her-or-hate-her persona as a wandering, spoiled millennial. &ldquo;I may be the voice of my generation,&rdquo; says her character, an aspiring writer based not so loosely on Dunham herself, or some version of a former self, in the show&rsquo;s pilot. &ldquo;Or at least a voice of a generation.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Following last year&rsquo;s finale, which featured one girl&rsquo;s deflowering and another&rsquo;s surprise wedding, the second season, which begins Jan. 13, promises a stalker ex-boyfriend and a hunky doctor.</p>
    
    <p>Even before its premiere last April, there was already buzz. &ldquo;I was surprised how early it happened&mdash;three weeks before the show was on the air,&rdquo; says co-executive producer Ilene Landress, self-described &ldquo;oldest girl on <em>Girls</em>.&rdquo; After 15 years at HBO, and producing credits on&nbsp;<em>The Sopranos&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mildred Pierce,</em>Landress has seen every version of hype&mdash;but nothing like this. </p>
    
    <p>There were inevitable accusations <em>Girls</em> wasn&rsquo;t new at all, that it was just another&nbsp;<em>Sex and the City</em>&nbsp;knock-off. &ldquo;Other than they&rsquo;re four women and they&rsquo;re in New York, I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; says Landress. The criticism was quaint, compared to a doctored show poster that circulated online with &ldquo;Nepotism&rdquo; in place of the show&rsquo;s title. Instead of the four girls&rsquo; names, it described their lineage instead: artist Laurie Simmons&rsquo;s daughter (Dunham as Hannah), NBC anchor Brian Williams (Williams as Marnie), playwright David Mamet&rsquo;s daughter (Zosia Mamet as Shoshanna), and Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke (Jemima Kirke as Jessa).</p>
    
    <p>Dunham&rsquo;s fast success, to some, was too easy. After a private liberal-arts education (her school, St. Ann&rsquo;s in Brooklyn Heights, doesn&rsquo;t grade students and has been described as &ldquo;an artsy Hogwarts&rdquo;) and an undergraduate degree in creative writing at Oberlin College, Dunham made her first feature film, 2010&rsquo;s indie comedy<em>&nbsp;Tiny Furniture,</em> about &ldquo;postgraduate delirium.&rdquo; Filmed at her parents&rsquo; apartment starring her family and friends, the film uses the same raw and sometimes shocking tone of&nbsp;<em>Girls</em>. (In one scene, while Dunham&rsquo;s character has unprotected sex, she asks, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have AIDS, do you?&rdquo;) In the film, actor Alex Karpovsky appears as a writer shopping a show to HBO. In a case of life imitating art, the film attracted the attention of hotshot L.A. producer Judd Apatow, who took Dunham under his wing. Six months later, HBO gave it the green light.</p>
    
    <p>Allegations of privilege were quickly compounded when the show&mdash;set in Brooklyn, where the population is 42 per cent white&mdash;aired with almost no people of colour, even in the background. Dunham insisted she was writing from her own &ldquo;half-Jew, half-WASP&rdquo; experience and wanted to avoid tokenism. <em>Girls</em> writer Lesley Arfin wasn&rsquo;t so eloquent: &ldquo;What really bothered me most about [the movie]&nbsp;<em>Precious</em>&nbsp;was that there was no representation of ME,&rdquo; she tweeted in April.</p>
    
    <p>With almost 500,000 Twitter followers, Dunham&mdash;who has been accused of &ldquo;casual racism&rdquo; by the New York City-based blog <em>Feministing</em>&mdash;compounded problems when she tweeted a pic of herself in a scarf worn like a hijab in August. Dunham promptly apologized for the transgression.</p>
    
    <p>Comedy is always hit-or-miss, the best kind walking a fine line between shock and decency, but in the age of social media, it can be especially polarizing. &ldquo;Sometimes it feels good, like you&rsquo;re unified with people similar to you,&rdquo; says Dunham of her impulsive&mdash;and compulsive&mdash;media-sharing habits. &ldquo;But sometimes it&rsquo;s a huge misfire and I want to shut off every Gmail account and stop twittering and pretend I never met Instagram.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Good and bad press, about the show itself and the zeitgeist, can be overwhelming. &ldquo;Lots of very smart people told me not to read the press&mdash;no offence!&mdash;especially the comments,&rdquo; says Williams, who plays Hannah&rsquo;s uptight roommate Marnie, and has slipped into very un-Marnie-like Uggs. She knows the show asks big questions, but insists the show is &ldquo;familiar-feeling and grounded in the real world.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Dunham, as a writer, is compelled to stay authentic, but as a producer, she must understand and navigate her audience&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what it is to be a writer,&rdquo; says Jenni Konner, 41, a writer (one of eight) and executive producer on <em>Girls</em>. She feels some criticism was fair&mdash;including the race complaints. &ldquo;People weren&rsquo;t wrong to say we weren&rsquo;t portraying all of New York,&rdquo; says Konner, promising season two makes a better effort. </p>
    
    <p>Other criticism wasn&rsquo;t so constructive. &ldquo;I object when people are rude about Lena showing her body,&rdquo; Konner says. Dunham seems to love nudity, especially the un-airbrushed kind&mdash;making <em>Girls</em> authentic to older male viewers hanging around after <em>Game of Thrones</em> on Sunday nights. At last year&rsquo;s Emmys, when&nbsp;<em>Girls</em>&nbsp;was nominated four times, Dunham appeared in a skit, naked on a toilet, eating a whole cake.</p>
    
    <p>Sloppy chic is a popular shtick&mdash;<em>30 Rock</em>&rsquo;s Liz Lemon, while gobbling a barbeque sandwich, shouts &ldquo;I can have it all!&rdquo;&mdash;but, like Tina Fey, Dunham&rsquo;s television persona is just one role for a burgeoning media mogul with fingers in many pies. While riding high on her status as a prodigy, Dunham whipped up a book proposal for&nbsp;<em>Not That Kind of Girl,</em> an advice book of essays, including &ldquo;Take my virginity (no really, take it)&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Internet boyfriend died (and so can yours).&rdquo; The proposal sparked a bidding war, and was scooped up by Random House for a reported $3.7 million. (Fey got $5 million for her book.)</p>
    
    <p>In mid-December Gawker acquired and leaked a copy of the 66-page proposal, which includes a chapter of reprinted emails to ex-boyfriends and a detailed list of Dunham&rsquo;s food diary. Reaction was split into two camps: those thrilled for Dunham&rsquo;s success and those disgusted that her undeserved celebrity had reached a new pinnacle.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re having a very successful moment in your career,&rdquo; says Dunham on set, where filming will continue past 4 a.m., &ldquo;there are still the same personal anxieties. You just have bigger opportunities in which to fail and humiliate yourself.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>But that&rsquo;s a good problem to have for a writer who writes about herself, and don&rsquo;t be surprised if a meta-version of Dunham&rsquo;s book drama soon reappears on the screen. This, says Konner, is Dunham&rsquo;s greatest gift as a writer. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go on a date, have a humiliating experience and, by the next day, is writing the comedy version.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Lena is a sponge, picking up things faster than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; says Landress. &ldquo;It electrifies her, passes through her, and she spits out these really interesting scripts.&rdquo; The flip side of this, of course, is that too much glittery success could mean the end of&nbsp;<em>Girls</em>. &ldquo;The more time she has to live her life, the better,&rdquo; says Landress, who fights to keep her star in New York. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s off living some weird Los Angeles life, I get a little skeptical.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>For Dunham, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but keep extracting confessions from her life&mdash;no matter how blessed&mdash;and hope her audience continues to relate to her. Because her success is contrary to the very platform she&rsquo;s built it on, backlash is inevitable. Meanwhile, mounting hype demands realer and rawer material. So does Dunham worry about revealing so much that there&rsquo;s nothing left? &ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; she admits, &ldquo;but at the same time, I don&rsquo;t know another way to work. So the same way I don&rsquo;t worry about my tattoos sagging, I don&rsquo;t worry about that either.&rdquo; </p>

    <abstract>A DIY kit turns vodka into urine-coloured booze&mdash;for $80</abstract>

  <body.content>
    <p>When a small mail-order company in northern Virginia recently marketed a kit for making your own gin, they quickly learned something about the contemporary imagination: in short, the glamour of the bootleg-era HBO series <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> counts for a lot more than, say, the visions of Hogarth or the sorrows of John Cheever. Which is to say that sales were through the roof.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Eleventh-century Italian monks. Early American colonists. Prohibition bootleggers . . . you,&rdquo; the attached instruction sheet begins. &ldquo;Welcome to the exclusive fraternity of small-batch, home gin producers.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Agreed, making one&rsquo;s own gin does seem like heady stuff. And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a fraternity or club anywhere near so exclusive that one can join for only $39.99, plus shipping. But alas, only moments after my kit arrived and I tore the box open on the kitchen counter with all the greedy anticipation of a six-year-old attacking the first gift of Christmas morning, it occurred to me that I hadn&rsquo;t thought this business through.</p>
    
    <p>For, other than the instruction sheet, all the kit includes are two empty glass bottles, a small plastic funnel, a strainer and two small tins of aromatic flavourings. The hard truth is that step one in making your own gin is walking over to your local liquor store to pick up a bottle of vodka. And unless you happen to be 16, it&rsquo;s hard to argue there is much cachet in <em>that</em>.</p>
    
    <p>To be fair, however, it should be pointed out that it&rsquo;s not dissimilar from real gin making. In the U.K., whence all my preferred dry gins originate, there is not a single gin distillery that makes its own alcohol. What&rsquo;s more, they all buy their raw alcohol from the same source. Which is to say that cheapo London dry gin and an ultra-premium bottle are each made from the very same product.</p>
    
    <p>But there are still plenty of good reasons that one should cost nearly double the other. The value of the particular formula for their respective infusions of botanicals and juniper is one. The method is another&mdash;for example, the singularly delicate flavouring of Bombay Sapphire is a result of its botanicals being suspended in baskets in the still, rather than mixed into the alcohol itself. More than any of that, value added comes from the number of distillations of the raw alcohol, one being the norm for a basic gin, up to four for an ultra-premium gin like Tanqueray 10.</p>
    
    <p>Extra distillation makes for a more refined, smoother final product. Which is why I doubted the gin kit&rsquo;s claims that it would turn &ldquo;a mediocre bottle of vodka into an outstanding bottle of homemade, small-batch gin.&rdquo; I was keen to give it a try, but I decided on two bottles of test vodka (one rough Canadian, one smooth Russian).</p>
    
    <p>As the kit includes only enough juniper (about 90 dried berries) and mixed botanicals (about 10 grams) to transform a single 750-ml bottle of vodka, this required dividing the samples into two, and half-emptying each bottle of vodka. Then, as per the instructions, I funnelled the juniper directly into the vodka, waited 24 hours and followed with the botanical mix&mdash;a combination of coriander, rosemary, lavender, rosehip, allspice, fennel seed, cardamom, bay leaf and Tellicherry black pepper. Twelve hours later you pass the infused vodka through the strainer, and presto, you have your &ldquo;homemade gin.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>It certainly smells like gin, but in appearance it has disturbing similarities to a urine sample. All the same, I had a sip&mdash;and found it to be flavoured with all the botanical character of a sound, basic gin. As for smoothness, the gin made from cheap vodka was unsurprisingly rough. And the one made from quality Russian vodka was adequately smooth.</p>
    
    <p>The thing is, though, if you add the $30-odd cost of a decent 750-ml bottle of vodka to a $39.99 gin kit&mdash;and shipping&mdash;you end up with a murky-yellow bottle of gin that set you back about $80, which is far more than the most expensive gin on the market. And that must be why the gin kit comes with only enough flavourings to transform a single bottle of vodka: once is fun, but not even a gin-addled lunatic would conduct this experiment twice.    </p>

  <photo.caption>Down and out in Prague: Homeless tour guide Karim stands at Prague&rsquo;s main railway station, one of the stops on his tour of the city&rsquo;s underbelly</photo.caption>
    
  <photo.byline>Petr Josek Snr/Reuters</photo.byline>
    
  <body.content>
    <p>His thick black eyeliner smudged and long dirty-blond hair in a ponytail, Karim holds a yellow umbrella high in the air as he walks through an unlit park in downtown Prague. He points to a group of men, barely visible in the dark. Heroin addicts about to shoot up, he explains to the group of tourists following him. After turning their attention to a few prostitutes on a corner, Karim opens up about his experience of living on and off the streets for more than 20 years.</p>
    
    <p>Since August, the homeless transsexual and former prostitute has been leading one of the hottest tours of Prague. Similar tours, led by homeless or once-homeless guides, have popped up in London, Amsterdam and San Francisco. Billed as alternative views of the cities, they have been praised for converting tourist dollars into employment for homeless people and criticized for turning homelessness into a tourist attraction.</p>
    
    <p>The past decade saw an explosion of poverty tourism in developing nations, with visitors traipsing through the slums of Mumbai or the <em>favelas</em> of Rio de Janeiro. Now it seems that poorism, as critics call it, has found a market in industrialized nations.</p>
    
    <p>Karim&rsquo;s tour is one of six offered by Pragulic, a non-profit group whose frontline includes five tour guides with varied experiences of homelessness, as well as translators who cater to English, German and even Vietnamese tourists. Each tour reflects the experiences of the guide; whether it&rsquo;s visiting the dumpsters where one of them often forages for food, or touring a suburb where another shares his tips on finding a place to sleep.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;At the beginning we got some negative responses, saying that we were running some kind of zoo by taking people to watch another group in need,&rdquo; says Pragulic co-founder  Tereza Jureckov&aacute;. She sees the tours as a bridge between the general public and the homeless, offering tourists a comfortable excursion into the &ldquo;kind of life that most people are often very afraid to talk about or afraid to see.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Pragulic guides take home half the ticket price from each tour, or about $5 for every tourist. The rest goes toward ongoing training and to provide more services to the homeless. Demand has been higher than expected among tourists and Czech nationals, and Jureckov&aacute; says they are a success because the tours allow people to &ldquo;experience how homeless live.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s not just authenticity drawing tourists to the seedy side of cities, says Ballu Thakur, who teaches a class on trends in tourism at George Brown College in Toronto. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;pure gawking,&rdquo; the kind of voyeurism where people end the tour gushing, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, am I glad that I don&rsquo;t live in this kind of place.&rdquo; He points to dozens of hurricane-themed bus tours that run through the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, where tourists jostle each other for the perfect snapshot of hurricane Katrina&rsquo;s destruction. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I kind of say&mdash;are you kidding me?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>But poverty tours are an easy way to engage with a complex social issue, says Thakur. It appeals to those who think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the granola-eating, Birkenstock-wearing activist, but I still want to make a difference. How do I do it? Let me do it the safe way.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>That was exactly what Union Gospel Mission had in mind this fall when it offered guided tours of Vancouver&rsquo;s Downtown Eastside. Part of Homelessness Action Week, they brought more than 300 people through one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like walking, in certain parts, through someone&rsquo;s living room,&rdquo; says organizer Keela Keeping about the tours, which were led by community members. &ldquo;It kind of turns everything on its head. Instead of it being, &lsquo;Oh, you poor people that don&rsquo;t have anything to offer,&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; she says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the experts now. You&rsquo;re going to teach us.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The tours were a success, but she hesitates at the idea of running them year round, or opening them to tourists. It might have more appeal in 10 years if the neighbourhood has tackled some of its poverty issues. Then the tours wouldn&rsquo;t be about showcasing problems, they would be about solutions, a kind of, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how we did it&mdash;here&rsquo;s what you can take back to your city.&rdquo;    </p>

    <abstract>Suddenly, so-called tongue diagnosis is all the rage&mdash;and not just in China</abstract>

    <p>Holly Fennell sees about 50 tongues a week. The first thing the naturopath looks at is the colour. A &ldquo;nice pinky-red&rdquo; is normal, but many of her patients have a dark purple hue, which is her first clue that there is something off with their energy, or ch&rsquo;i. A yellowish coating may indicate the flu or a cold. If the outside edge is bumpy, it could be a sign of anxiety. And Fennell, who has been practising Chinese medicine in Toronto&rsquo;s tony Summerhill neighbourhood for 10 years, has a very deep line down the middle of hers, which she says points to her asthma. Patients think she is psychic, the way she reads their tongues. </p>
    
    <p>Jen Miller, who lives in Toronto, has seen two traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors. The first time, she was feeling sluggish, headachey and queasy, &ldquo;not really a surprise because I&rsquo;d recently had a bad breakup.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The TCM doctor examined her mouth with a depressor and a little light, then asked her to move her tongue up and down. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Oh, not sleeping enough . . . you&rsquo;re so sad . . . more water will make those headaches stop.&rsquo; &rdquo; Miller saw a second TCM doctor a year later for stubborn acne. &ldquo;He started all our visits by looking in my mouth. The first time he looked in and said, &lsquo;Uh! So much candy! All that sugar!&rsquo; &rdquo; The night before, admits Miller, she had eaten a box of chocolates. &ldquo;Again, it was fascinating but creepy.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>As Westerners become more proactive about their health and more open to alternatives to conventional medicine, tongue diagnosis is taking off. When TCM practitioner James Rohr started at the Canyon Ranch Hotel and Spa in Miami Beach four years ago, he thought about what would appeal to guests. &ldquo;The tongue was an easy choice for a lecture, because everyone has one and most people never think twice about theirs.&rdquo; Due to demand from curious guests, &ldquo;Let Me See Your Tongue&rdquo; has been a popular fixture ever since.</p>
    
    <p>Tongue diagnosis is hardly new; it has been used in more than 3,000 years of Chinese medicine. &ldquo;Every medical system has to have a way to &lsquo;see&rsquo; inside the body,&rdquo; says the Miami-based acupuncture and herbal therapy specialist. While Western medicine relies on blood work, scans and X-rays, Chinese medicine uses the much less expensive&mdash;not to mention readily accessible&mdash;tongue.</p>
    
    <p>Any deviation from normal&mdash;&ldquo;It just looks healthy, like a good piece of meat,&rdquo; Rohr says on his website video&mdash;&ldquo;shows some energetic imbalance with that person.&rdquo; Over time, with acupuncture or herbs and special teas, the tongue recovers as the patient heals.</p>
    
    <p>Common diagnoses from tongue exams include insomnia, digestive upsets, headaches, constipation and allergies. &ldquo;If you think of illness like a tree with roots and branches, the branches are the symptoms while the roots are the underlying causes. The tongue often gives us a picture of the roots so that we can identify the energetic patterns that would lead this person to manifest symptoms, or the branches, in particular areas of the body,&rdquo; says Rohr. &ldquo;The tongue is like a barometer that is constantly giving you feedback about the choices you&rsquo;re making in your life.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Western-trained doctors are often skeptical of Eastern medicine, and tongue diagnosis is no exception. At Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket, Ont., emergency-room physician Jason Falk is not peering into patients&rsquo; mouths to check their ch&rsquo;i. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of tongue diagnosis and I&rsquo;ve been working for 18 years,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What can I say? I don&rsquo;t look at them much. The tongue is not a big focus of mine.&rdquo; Using the tongue as a diagnostic tool, the one thing Falk says he could deduce is whether or not the person is a coffee drinker.</p>
    
    <p>Rohr says healthy tongues are becoming harder to find. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen tongues that have black coatings, peeled coatings, cracked all over, super swollen and huge tongues and very, very short ones. You name it and I&rsquo;ve seen it.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Now Rohr has invented an app called Tungz! that provides pictures of healthy tongues. He&rsquo;s also marketed a line of herbal teas to treat sick ones. But he&rsquo;s learned to keep a low profile at social gatherings, because once people find out what he does, they are far from tongue-tied: &ldquo;Even at parties, people stick their tongues out at me.&rdquo;

    <abstract>Once more counterculture than pop culture, Tegan and Sara chart a new course</abstract>

  <photo.caption>Alt rockers no more: Identical indie darlings Tegan and Sara Quin go with the mainstream flow and&mdash;surprise!&mdash;more people are listening </photo.caption>

    <p>For more than 10 years Tegan and Sara Quin have made music that, by their own admission, is more counterculture than pop culture. Steeped in acoustic and electric guitars and informed by punk and folk artists, the past six albums by Calgary&rsquo;s famous sister act are classified by iTunes as alternative music. But after their 2009 album <em>Sainthood</em>, the 32-year-old identical twins decided to rethink their approach to songwriting. &ldquo;We became known as kind of a Canadian cult band in some parts of the world,&rdquo; Tegan says during a recent visit to Toronto, hours before hitting the stage to perform songs from the new album, <em>Heartthrob</em>. &ldquo;It felt very limiting. The reality is indie rock just isn&rsquo;t as popular anymore, especially in Europe. We used to be so opposed to sounding current. We were either a step behind or ahead.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Save for a major international hit in 2004 called <em>Walking With a Ghost</em> (covered soon afterward by the White Stripes), their previous releases, which provided years of gigs and decent reviews, never had enough mass appeal to crown the <em>Billboard</em> charts or enough bass-line grit for major club play. The musical makeover began when the pair met the Dutch DJ Ti&euml;sto, whose beat-driven remix of <em>Back in Your Head</em> from their 2007 album <em>The Con</em> started reaching audiences they didn&rsquo;t even know existed. &ldquo;When he came along, he opened our minds and made us think about what kinds of opportunities we were shutting out,&rdquo; Sara says. It led to another collaboration that produced an ear worm of a dance track called <em>Feel It in My Bones</em>&mdash;a song that ended up charting in Canada. The track pushed the duo to team up with electronic producers such as David Guetta for <em>Every Chance We Get We Run</em> and Morgan Page for a cut called <em>Body Work</em>. All three songs have received much more radio and club play than any of their rock singles since <em>Walking With a Ghost</em>. </p>
    
    <p>Driven by this second wind, the sisters swapped their signature guitar-heavy riffs for piano-plucked and synth-pinched choruses on <em>Heartthrob</em> (scheduled for release Jan. 29). The disc of pop and dance&mdash;which includes the new, chart-climbing single, <em>Closer</em>&mdash;has some standout vocal moments. A track called <em>I Was a Fool</em> sounds like a song that could win Alicia Keys another Grammy. Sara has also written what she calls &ldquo;my version of an &rsquo;80s power ballad&rdquo; on a slow jam called <em>Now I&rsquo;m All Messed Up</em>, which touches on her past girlfriends and her general fear of singledom.  </p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been afraid of putting it all out there,&rdquo; Sara explains. &ldquo;We are both gay people who are now making pop for everyone. The music is still very personal though; it&rsquo;s about our lives and our relationships, but finding someone to love is tough for all people. For the longest time, I had a hard time meeting someone,&rdquo; she says, adding that both she and her sister have been in happy, long-term relationships for years now. &ldquo;You have to understand, I&rsquo;ve had a career since I was 17. I owned a house and paid taxes for it at 26. It was hard meeting someone like me with the same interests.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>What sets <em>Heartthrob</em> apart from their other albums was the way it was made and marketed. Typically, the sisters write songs separately at their respective homes (Tegan lives in Los Angeles and Vancouver, Sara in Montreal and New York), but many of the songs for <em>Heartthrob</em> were written together. And those who pre-ordered the album got a limited-edition magazine featuring Tegan and Sara on the <em>Teen Beat</em>-like cover, which promised &ldquo;everything you need to know about Tegan and Sara RIGHT NOW.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Their transformation and subsequent success has one famous fan, the Canadian pop darling Carly Rae Jepsen, who saw them 10 years ago at a folk festival in Courtenay, B.C. </p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Hearing them has changed the way I&rsquo;ve written songs,&rdquo; says Jepsen, who recorded a song Sara wrote called <em>Sweetie</em> on her latest album <em>Kiss</em>. &ldquo;When you see someone before they were big and then [they] get the recognition they deserve, you feel like you were behind them from the beginning. When I think of them, I feel like a proud grandma.&rdquo;  </p>

    <p>The holy or the broken: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley &amp; the unlikely ascent of &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo;</p>
    
    <p>Alan Light</p>
    
    <p>The pleasures of this modest, original book are as unexpected as its subject: the miraculous (and ongoing) resurrection of the 28-year-old Leonard Cohen song <em>Hallelujah</em>. When Cohen first recorded it, his record label refused to release it. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said the president of CBS Records when he listened to it. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t pop music . . . this is a disaster.&rdquo; Since then, of course, <em>Hallelujah</em> has become one of the most covered songs in music history, a one-size-fits-all hymn that can express both doubt and reassurance.</p>
    
    <p>The song languished in obscurity until Jeff Buckley recorded his own intense, angelic-erotic version, which became his signature number. After his death, <em>Hallelujah</em> was taken up by a whole rainbow of artists, from Rufus Wainwright, Bono and Justin Timberlake, to Bob Dylan and C&eacute;line Dion. At the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics, k.d. lang nailed her lucid, world-embracing version. With its simple, seductive melody and lyrics that move between the sexual and the spiritual, the song can cast a spell in any context. &ldquo;Those who want or need it to serve as a hymn, a balm, can find that sense of soaring grace,&rdquo; the author writes, &ldquo;and those who respond to its sense of struggle and confusion can present that as the song&rsquo;s backbone. There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;right way&rsquo; to sing <em>Hallelujah</em>.&rdquo; Light, the former editor of <em>Spin</em> magazine, does a deft, unsentimental job of tracking how a little masterpiece of a song crested the waves of the music industry to become a modern anthem. Wonder if this has anything to do with Cohen&rsquo;s job as a counsellor at a summer camp in the Laurentians, where he first learned to play for others? Now it&rsquo;s a camp song sung around the world. </p>

    <p>Thirst: Water &amp; power in the ancient world</p>
    
    <p>Steven Mithen</p>
    
    <p>Scholars who mine the past for information always do so in the light of contemporary concerns. Throughout <em>Thirst</em>, Mithen, an eminent archaeologist at the U.K.&rsquo;s University of Reading, is attuned to the massive floods and severe droughts the world is experiencing today. Climate change has wrecked entire civilizations before: when the water loses its steady, life-enabling flow&mdash;when there&rsquo;s too much or too little, for too long&mdash;things fall apart.</p>
    
    <p>Mithen&rsquo;s thoughts on the imminent future of Peru&mdash;where Inca hydraulic engineers once constructed an irrigation and drainage system at Machu Picchu that still dazzles modern experts&mdash;are convincingly gloomy. The mountain glaciers that provided the Incas with their meltwater are retreating at the rate of 60 m or more a year, and scientists expect every glacier below 5,500 m to be gone by 2015. Modern Lima&rsquo;s 10 million people are equally dependent on that meltwater, and &ldquo;how they will cope remains unclear,&rdquo; writes Mithen. Further stressing diminished supplies is a need the ancients never experienced&mdash;water for hydro power&mdash;and a danger they were all too familiar with: poison. Irrigate for too long, long-ago Sumerians found, and water-borne salts will start to choke the fields; in contemporary Peru, mining operations are leaching toxins into the water that sustains agriculture. Competing water users are starting to face off, and some clashes have turned violent.</p>
    
    <p>Mithen&rsquo;s survey of the hydraulic wonders achieved by ancient civilizations from Peru to Cambodia was written with all that in mind. Does the collapse of those cultures, due partly to forces beyond their control (changing rainfall) and partly to their own errors (deforestation), predict the future of our own water crisis, only on a far vaster scale? Maybe, muses the sober-minded archaeologist. Growing populations forced those cultures to increase their water use to unsustainable levels&mdash;to the point where there was no give in the system when the climate changed. The more complex their water management became, the more the civilizations grew autocratic. Moderns, however, know what went wrong: should we summon the will, Mithen writes, we can avoid their fate.</p>

    <p>The Amistad Rebellion: an Atlantic odyssey of slavery and freedom</p>
    
    <p>Marcus Rediker</p>
    
    <p>The 1839 rebellion on board La Amistad has waxed and waned in the public consciousness. This shipload of slaves who broke free of their chains, killed the captain and attempted to sail back to Africa&mdash;only to be captured and put on trial for piracy in the United States&mdash; once dominated slavery debates around the world, and riveted the emerging popular media in the U.S. Their story then faded from view, until movie director Steven Spielberg brought his version to the big screen in 1997. Since then, a cottage industry of Amistadia has enjoyed a resurgence, including a life-sized replica moored in New Haven, Conn., and an outsized presence in American high-school texts.</p>
    
    <p>Making his contribution to modern interest in the rebellion, Rediker aims to tell the parts Spielberg left out. While the Supreme Court ultimately set the Amistad Africans free in a politically charged trial, Rediker figures the slaves themselves deserve the bulk of the attention. He redirects the story away from the courtroom, where the movie spent most of its time, and back to the shores of Africa. &ldquo;Curiously,&rdquo; writes Rediker, &ldquo;the American legal system has emerged as the story&rsquo;s hero&mdash;the very system which, in 1839, held 2&frac12; million African Americans in bondage.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Contemporary public fascination with the slaves provides the historian with a rich trove of information to draw upon. The 53 men and children, led by charismatic Joseph Cinqu&eacute;, became instant national celebrities. They attracted ample newspaper coverage, both pro and con; academic investigations into their language, physiology and culture; plus travelling art exhibits, and even a stage version of their tale. A much fuller picture of the Amistad rebels thus emerges, covering their life and eventual enslavement in Africa, membership in the secret Poro society&mdash;a kind of African Masonic Lodge&mdash;as well as their efforts directing their own legal defence.</p>
    
    <p>It might have required skilled lawyers and aggressive abolitionist lobbying to spare the Amistad Africans from conviction at the hands of the American judicial system, but Rediker leaves no doubt they were free men from the moment they were born.</p>

    <p>What are you looking at? The surprising, shocking, and sometimes strange story of 150 years of modern art</p>
    
    <p>Will Gompertz</p>
    
    <p>Inspired by his one-man comedy show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, this book is Gompertz&rsquo;s chatty retelling of the last 150 years of modern art. It isn&rsquo;t academic, he promises, then playfully links up the &ldquo;isms&rdquo; of art history, from Impressionism onward. Gompertz calls his book &ldquo;factastic&rdquo; on YouTube, mirroring an art trend he identifies in the book&rsquo;s last chapter. And, with Gompertz striking a readable balance of scholarly detail, art anecdote and pop culture references, readers will make it to the last chapter.  </p>
    
    <p>Gompertz wins points immediately by daring to talk about money and, by extension, class. Soon after, he breaks what may be a code of silence by describing&mdash;almost satirizing&mdash;the tensions that play out when curators try to name an exhibition and why, as he puts it, &ldquo;curators talk bollocks.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to forget Gompertz is a Brit, as he laces his prose with words like &ldquo;blimey&rdquo; and &ldquo;bollocks.&rdquo;&nbsp;The lad-like banter, coming from an author who was a former director at the Tate gallery and is now the BBC arts editor, adds accessibility. Winningly, he folds in hip references to Jonathan Ive, head of design at Apple, David Lynch, Tom Ford, Bang &amp; Olufsen, Franz Ferdinand, Harvey Weinstein, Google, Dennis Hopper and Susan Boyle.(&ldquo;As it turned out, Rousseau was the Susan Boyle of his day.&rdquo;) </p>
    
    <p>After examining why the public suspects modern art is a sham, he intelligently explains the seemingly outrageous prices of some work. His introduction to Minimalist sculpture is hilarious, and his lengthy treatment of Jeff Wall will warm Canadian readers&rsquo; hearts. </p>
    
    <p>But where are the pictures? Twenty-eight colour plates are not enough. Why would the publisher print a book about art without an adequate budget for photo permissions? Bloody shame, that.</p>

    <p>The twelve tribes of Hattie</p>
    
    <p>Ayana Mathis</p>
    
    <p>When Oprah Winfrey anoints a book as her newest Book Club pick&mdash;even on the lacking-in-national-syndication-TV-show version&mdash;people take notice. It happened last summer with Cheryl Strayed&rsquo;s memoir <em>Wild</em>, which spent weeks on the bestseller lists after being stamped with the Oprah seal of approval. And it will certainly happen again with Ayana Mathis&rsquo;s debut novel <em>The Twelve Tribes of Hattie</em>, a series of family portraits that ultimately revolve around the fortunes of one forceful woman, Hattie Shepherd.</p>
    
    <p>When we first meet Hattie, it&rsquo;s 1925, and she&rsquo;s new to motherhood and to Philadelphia, having left Georgia as part of an early wave of the Great Migration. Over the next 55 years, even when she&rsquo;d &ldquo;had enough of blood and milk and birthing,&rdquo; she will raise nine more children, see them through waves of joy but mostly calamity, and bear witness to the great changes wrought by the civil rights movement&mdash;even though most won&rsquo;t directly affect her. Hattie will endure tough times with an inner resilience she can rely on, largely because she has no choice.</p>
    
    <p><em>The Twelve Tribes of Hattie</em> works wonderfully as a family drama, shifting from perspective to perspective&mdash;each &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; belongs to a different Shepherd voice&mdash;to show how Hattie&rsquo;s children disappoint her. All of them, from Floyd, a wayward, wandering musician, to Bell, engaged in mutinous rebellion against her mother, fail to achieve what they believe to be their heart&rsquo;s desire. But Mathis&rsquo;s real accomplishment is her portrayal of larger American concerns: struggles with poverty, racism, sexism, religion and living a worthwhile life. There are no easy solutions, but in Mathis&rsquo;s expert hands, the Great Migration comes alive as a living, breathing journey.</p>

    <p>Marmee &amp; Louisa: The untold story of Louisa May Alcott and her mother</p>
    
    <p>Eve LaPlante</p>
    
    <p>In the spring of 1868, Louisa May Alcott was 35, and not interested in writing books for children. She preferred &ldquo;melodramatic tales of murder, revenge and interracial love affairs.&rdquo; But her chief interest was looking after her mother, Abigail, who had brought up four daughters in poverty and continued to live hand-to-mouth with her brilliant but unsuccessful husband, Bronson. So when a Boston publishing house offered Alcott $500 to produce a book for girls, she settled down to write <em>Little Women</em>, the novel that would make her famous and, more important, rich. &ldquo;Hard times for the Alcotts are over forever,&rdquo; she announced upon learning that 3,000 copies of the second instalment of <em>Little Women</em>(the two parts later became one novel) had been sold before hitting the shelves. &ldquo;I feel as if I could die in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>When Abigail lay dying nine years later, she looked up at Alcott and called her &ldquo;Marmee,&rdquo; mistaking her second daughter for her own mother. The lines were indeed blurry at times. LaPlante pieces together the letters and journals of Alcott, Abigail, Bronson and other friends and relatives (some of which LaPlante, great-great-granddaughter of Alcott&rsquo;s first cousin, found in her mother&rsquo;s attic) to create a portrait of the family. Abigail, stuck in a troubled and often distant marriage, frequently leaned on her daughters for financial and emotional support, and none more than Alcott. By age 8, Alcott was no longer in school, her help too important at home. By 15, she was in the workforce&mdash;as a maid, teacher and nanny. By 19, she was selling poems and stories, and gradually became the head of the household.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>But Abigail was also central to her daughter&rsquo;s career. A fierce advocate of abolition and suffrage, she taught her daughters to believe in their own agency. Recognizing in Alcott her own &ldquo;wretchedness of spirit,&rdquo; Abigail felt writing could be a &ldquo;safety valve&rdquo; for her daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;smothered sorrow.&rdquo; With tenderness and warmth, Abigail encouraged Alcott to find her voice. Her efforts, echoed in those of <em>Little Women</em>&rsquo;s Marmee with Jo, helped her daughter deliver one of the most beloved stories of the 19th century.</p>

  <photo.caption>Next generation: Disney took notice of Boy Meets World&rsquo;s huge online fan base and commissioned a pilot for a sequel series</photo.caption>

  <body.content>
    <p>Like many people in their 20s and 30s, Laura Hughes is excited about the new incarnation of the &rsquo;90s sitcom <em>Boy Meets World</em>. Hughes, a writer of young-adult novels who started publishing online reviews of the show in 2003 as a college freshman, is one of the fans who turned the coming-of-age story of a boy named Cory from a minor &rsquo;90s series into a franchise: Disney has taken note of its huge online fan base and commissioned a pilot for a sequel series. &ldquo;I have high hopes for <em>Girl Meets World</em> if it understands why we love <em>Boy Meets World</em>,&rdquo; says Hughes, who is based in Massachusetts. Who would have thought there&rsquo;d be such a following for a show about a boy with a girlfriend named Topanga?</p>
    
    <p>Since the news broke that both Ben Savage (Cory) and Danielle Fishel (Topanga) have signed up to appear in <em>Girl Meets World,</em>a show about their characters&rsquo; daughter, the pilot has had more coverage than many shows that are actually on the air. When Rider Strong, who played Cory&rsquo;s best friend, Shawn, announced on his website that he had &ldquo;no official involvement&rdquo; in the sequel, it was picked up by major gossip outlets like <em>TMZ</em>, <em>Perez Hilton</em> and <em>Salon</em>. Jeff Menell, a writer on the show for all seven seasons, says the &ldquo;emotional response&rdquo; to the announcement has made him realize &ldquo;the amazing and enormous impact <em>Boy Meets World</em> had.&rdquo; </p>
    
    <p>Usually a show that gets a sequel series was a phenomenon in its own time, like <em>Dallas</em>. But <em>Boy Meets World</em> was mostly ignored when it was part of ABC&rsquo;s kid-friendly &ldquo;TGIF&rdquo; lineup from 1993 to 2000. &ldquo;We never felt we got the respect we deserved,&rdquo; says Menell. But when it went into reruns, it exploded. Like many fans, Hughes got hooked later. &ldquo;I was thinking I might write an article for my comedy website,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;Before I knew it, I&rsquo;d reached a level of massive obsession.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>She&rsquo;s not the only one. Menell recalls a recent incident where a coat-check girl saw the <em>Boy Meets World</em> logo on his jacket &ldquo;and went nuts. She was a huge fan. It was a cool moment that got a second&rsquo;s worth of respect from my usually unimpressed buddies.&rdquo; And apart from getting millions of views for its episodes on YouTube, the show has inspired tributes usually reserved for classics. Last year, the gaming website <em>IGN</em> ran an article called &ldquo;Lessons learned from<em> Boy Meets World</em>,&rdquo; and in October, <em>Hollywood.com</em> writer Matt Patches published a 2,700-word oral history of the episode in which the characters dream they&rsquo;re all being killed by a slasher. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been a great family sitcom since,&rdquo; Patches insists.</p>
    
    <p>Why would a low-budget sitcom with huge &rsquo;90s phones become a cultural touchstone in 2013? Hughes thinks it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;the creative team got a little loopy,&rdquo; writing meta-humorous jokes for older fans. She points to the one where Cory&rsquo;s crazy brother Eric &ldquo;joins the cast of the gentle family sitcom <em>Kid Gets Acquainted With Universe</em>,&rdquo; or the one where &ldquo;Shawn spends an entire episode looking disturbingly hot in drag.&rdquo; These surreal moments gave the show more hip cachet than other TGIF sitcoms like <em>Full House</em>. </p>
    
    <p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>Girl Meets World</em>is a sure hit; its style might be out of place 20 years on. <em>Boy Meets World</em> had grown-up jokes because it aired on ABC, and Menell says it was also &ldquo;about the parents. It was about the teachers.&rdquo; The sequel will be on the Disney Channel, where most shows are what Patches calls &ldquo;niche entertainment&rdquo; for today&rsquo;s kids, who haven&rsquo;t heard of Cory or his wise teacher Mr. Feeny. </p>
    
    <p>Hughes points to Canada&rsquo;s <em>Degrassi: The Next Generation</em> as an example of how to bring modern kids into the fold. It brought back some of the original cast, but &ldquo;used them sparingly, instead allowing the new kids plenty of room to come into their own. <em>Girl Meets World</em>will have to do the same.&rdquo; Even if it doesn&rsquo;t, the buzz around it may have cemented the old show&rsquo;s unlikely icon status. It seems that way to Menell, whose contributions to the original series included the slasher parody and an episode where Eric disguises himself as a tree. &ldquo;I always loved my time on <em>Boy Meets World</em>,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But now I have a new-found pride about it all.&rdquo;   </p>

    <p>So the Mayans were wrong, the world didn&rsquo;t end and I&rsquo;ve lost my last, best excuse to put off cleaning the basement. Thanks for nothing, 2012.</p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, the outgoing year did us one favour: it produced a bumper crop of high achievers who suffered very public failures. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to salute those whose personal catastrophes made us feel by comparison much, much better about ourselves.</p>
    
    <p><em>David Petraeus</em>. In a country in which Democrats and Republicans can&rsquo;t even agree on whether Clint Eastwood looked stupid talking to a chair, Petraeus was admired by partisans on both sides. In 2012, he once again brought together red state and blue state in a shared thought: shouldn&rsquo;t the nation&rsquo;s top spy know better than to use Gmail to make naughty talk with his mistress? He&rsquo;s the head of the CIA&mdash;surely he has access to advanced cryptographic devices or a shoe phone. At minimum, Petraeus could have dispatched a shadowy figure to a darkened parking garage to pass along secret messages: &ldquo;The Falcon thinks your thighs are shapely, Snowman.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p><em>Linda McMahon</em>. The co-architect (with her husband Vince) of a professional wrestling empire, McMahon lost by a wide margin in her second bid to be elected to the U.S. Senate. She has now spent more than $100 million to be publicly humiliated in front of all Americans. One small consolation: this gives her something in common with the Boston Red Sox.</p>
    
    <p><em>Karl Rove</em>. The famed political strategist suffered a credibility meltdown on the night of the U.S. election, stubbornly refusing to accept that Barack Obama had won re-election. It reminded me of my thought process during the <em>Lost</em> finale: <em>It can&rsquo;t be over yet! Give them just one more episode and they&rsquo;ll figure out a way for it not to suck!</em></p>
    
    <p>It was tough to watch Rove. We&rsquo;ve all been confronted by the truth of a reality that doesn&rsquo;t match up with our imagined world. For some, it&rsquo;s discovering that the Grade 7 girls weren&rsquo;t actually turned on by my light sabre routine. I mean, by your light sabre routine. Obviously, I didn&rsquo;t have a light sabre routine that I performed in my bathrobe while humming the Star Wars theme because that would be sad. It&rsquo;s silly even to suggest that I choreographed and obsessively practised such a routine. Unless seeing this routine is something you&rsquo;d be interested&mdash;no, no, of course not. I&rsquo;ll put back your bathrobe.</p>
    
    <p><em>The guy in charge of Apple Maps</em>. Thanks to this selfless hero, any future gross incompetence of our own in the workplace will look like regular, ordinary incompetence. <em>Yes, boss, I showed up drunk for the meeting and insulted the client&rsquo;s mother using limericks and doodles&mdash;but I did not mastermind a widely used GPS system that directs someone searching for downtown Baltimore to the middle of Mexico or possibly the moon. So . . . employee of the month?</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Mitt Romney</em>. The Republican candidate used the strategy of repeatedly reinventing himself in the hopes that eventually enough Americans would like one of him. I&rsquo;m a pragmatic moderate! Now I&rsquo;m a hard-core conservative! Given another few months, we would likely have been introduced to Mitt Romney, Asian lady golfer. Recent reports indicate Romney is struggling to cope with his defeat. He&rsquo;s been sleeping in. He&rsquo;s been obsessing over campaign decisions.

    <p><em>Greece</em>. The philosophers, the Olympic movement, the whole birthplace of democracy thing&mdash;a noble national heritage built over the course of centuries. But over the span of just a few years the country has become defined instead by chronic unemployment, the recurring threat of economic collapse and the movie <em>300</em>. Today, Greece is on the verge of selling the Acropolis on Craigslist and everyone thinks its ancient city states were the cradle of hyper-stylized bare-chested homoeroticism. It&rsquo;s enough to make Italy feel better about itself.</p>
    
    <p><em>Lance Armstrong</em>. Talk about a guy who had it all: money, fame, yellow. And to see it all slip away just because every single thing he accomplished as an athlete was built on the most elaborate systemic cheating regimen ever uncovered in the entire history of sport. It is truly the opposite of heartbreaking. I personally look forward to the revelation that Armstrong never even rode in those Tour de France races&mdash;that it was all Hollywood trickery, like the moon landing or Cuba Gooding Jr. seeming like a good actor in that one movie.</p>

    <p>Adrian Johann Oliver was born March 16, 1984, at the former Grace Hospital in Vancouver, now the B.C. Women&rsquo;s Hospital and Health Centre. He arrived two months early and about seven minutes before his identical twin brother, Ben. Adrian weighed just three pounds, nine ounces. Ben was a little bigger at three pounds, 11 ounces. Their mother, 20-year-old Katherine Oliver, was flown to Vancouver by air ambulance from Williams Lake, B.C., where her husband, Joe, an RCMP officer, was stationed.</p>
    
    <p>Adrian and Ben spent their first two months in side-by-side incubators in the neo-natal unit. Katherine stayed with them until they weighed five pounds and she could take them home. After that, Adrian and Ben were rarely apart.</p>
    
    <p>They were bubbly sports-mad boys who played hockey, soccer, baseball, football and rugby. Katherine can&rsquo;t remember ever hearing them fight. &ldquo;You never thought of one without the other,&rdquo; she says. Six years later, another brother, Thomas, arrived and the twins took him under their wing. In 1989, Joe was transferred to Woodstock, N.B., and the family moved into a house right beside the RCMP detachment. The twins would watch the officers entering and leaving the building and pretend they were Mounties too.</p>
    
    <p>As little kids, Adrian and Ben vowed to stay together forever. Katherine once overheard them in the bedroom, plotting their futures. &ldquo;They were going to live in the same apartment building when they grew up. One would live on one side, the other would live across the hall.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>In 1999, Joe was promoted to sergeant in the RCMP&rsquo;s customs and excise branch in Ottawa. The Olivers settled in Orleans, just east of the city, and the boys enrolled at St. Peter&rsquo;s High School. Adrian played left wing for the Rockland Nationals, a Junior C hockey team. His coach said he&rsquo;d never seen a player give so much effort.</p>
    
    <p>The twins went on to Algonquin College and later Carleton University, where they both studied criminology. They shared every single class. Ben typically got the higher grades, &ldquo;but just by a bit.&rdquo; Everyone, it seemed, liked the boys with the movie-star good looks. One day, on the bus home from college, a modelling agent handed Adrian a business card. Soon, the twins were flying to the U.S. and Europe on modelling shoots. They never intended to model forever, and their parents were urging them to find more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; careers. In 2006, Adrian and Ben wrote the RCMP entrance exams&mdash;together.</p>
    
    <p>Ben was accepted first and headed to the RCMP training depot in Regina. It was the twins&rsquo; only time apart. When Adrian arrived six months later, some teachers mistook him for Ben. In Regina, Adrian met Shelagh Mitchell, a cadet from Kelowna, B.C. On her first day, he was part of a troop showing newcomers the ropes. When it was Adrian&rsquo;s turn to speak, his classmates exploded into laughter, Shelagh says. &ldquo;You could tell that everyone just loved him.&rdquo; Adrian blushed and bent his head. Two months later, he asked her out.</p>
    
    <p>Shelagh saw the bond between Adrian and Ben. &ldquo;You could not get in between those two,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That relationship had to be respected because it was so strong.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>After graduation, Adrian was assigned to the Surrey detachment in B.C.&rsquo;s Lower Mainland. Shelagh got a job in the Burnaby detachment, where Ben had been working for nearly a year.</p>
    
    <p>Adrian and Shelagh moved into a townhouse beside Burnaby&rsquo;s Deer Park. Ben was a frequent visitor. The twins jogged in the park and worked out at the Burnaby detachment&rsquo;s gym. Those were happy years, Ben and Shelagh say.</p>
    
    <p>Adrian took his job seriously, Ben says. He relished the grittier aspects of beat work&mdash;the drunken brawls and domestic squabbles&mdash;that drive some officers to desk jobs. He thought it was important &ldquo;to be able to walk into a house where people have problems and be able to resolve them.&rdquo; But he also had a playful, &ldquo;goofy&rdquo; streak, Shelagh says. &ldquo;If I was cooking in the kitchen, he&rsquo;d grab me and would make me two-step and spin. He was always in a good mood.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Six months ago, a unit opened up in their complex. Ben moved in right beside his brother, just as they&rsquo;d always planned.</p>
    
    <p>On the morning of Nov. 13, Adrian was on duty in Surrey, winding down a 12-hour shift. He was on the lookout for a stolen pickup truck and was driving his unmarked vehicle above the speed limit when he collided with a transport truck. He died at the scene. </p>
