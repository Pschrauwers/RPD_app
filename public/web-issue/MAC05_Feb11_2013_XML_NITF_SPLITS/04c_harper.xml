    <p>Earlier this week, Stephen Harper surprised his nearly 300,000 Twitter followers by tweeting photos and video from a typical day at home and on Parliament Hill. One of the most striking posts was a short video showing him entering his Monday-morning senior staff meeting. It was a rare look at the advisers who are on hand to brief the PM as he begins his work week. </p>
    
    <p>Many of these people are barely known outside Harper’s ofﬁce. Their hiring and departure is almost never announced in a news release. </p>
    
    <p>This isn’t the only power group in Harper’s Ottawa—cabinet ministers and their staffs have important responsibilities; top bureaucrats manage departments numbering in the thousands—but in a city where it sometimes seems that clout increases with proximity to Harper, this is literally the inner circle.</p>
    
 
    <p>Jeremy Hunt </p>
    
    <p>Executive assistant </p>
    
    <p>The 28-year-old Albertan is Harper’s “body man.” He is the PM’s gatekeeper and constant helper.</p>
    
 
    <p>Carl Vallée </p>
    
    <p>Press secretary </p>
    
    <p>Harper’s main French-language spokesperson.</p>
    
 
    <p>Martin Bélanger </p>
    
    <p>Executive director, Conservative research bureau </p>
    
    <p>Bélanger runs the party’s research and communications branch.</p>
    
 
    <p>André Bachand </p>
    
    <p>Senior adviser </p>
    
    <p>A former Progressive Conservative MP who left politics in 2004 rather than run under Harper, he  was appointed after the 2011 election  to try to improve Conservative fortunes in Quebec.</p>
    
 
    <p>Stephen Lecce </p>
    
    <p>Deputy director  of communications </p>
    
    <p>He met Harper as a student politician at the University of Western Ontario, helped Julian Fantino get elected and now works on shaping the government’s daily message.</p>
    
 
    <p>Joanne McNamara </p>
    
    <p>Deputy chief of staff </p>
    
    <p>Moved to Harper’s office last autumn after several years running Heritage Minister James Moore’s office.</p>
 
    <p>Nigel Wright </p>
    
    <p>Chief of staff </p>
    
    <p>Wright is the third man to run Harper’s office since 2006.  On leave from Bay Street, he keeps crazy hours and is the government’s most powerful manager. </p>
    
 
    <p>Michael White </p>
    
    <p>Director of strategic communications </p>
    
    <p>A cheerful regular on Harper campaigns since 2008, he has worked his way up in the communications shop.</p>
    
 
    <p>Alykhan Velshi </p>
    
    <p>Director of planning </p>
    
    <p>The former Jason Kenney aide and founder of the Ethical Oil advocacy group works at the intersection between policy and electoral politics, ensuring that the government’s actions increase its chances of re-election.</p>
    
 
    <p>Rachel Curran </p>
    
    <p>Director of policy </p>
    
    <p>Curran came from British Columbia politics through Vic Toews’s office to lead the Prime Minister’s Office’s policy shop. She’s perhaps the best example of the way clout and low public profile combine in this PMO.</p>
    
 
    <p>Chris Woodcock </p>
    
    <p>Director, issues management </p>
    
    <p>In charge of putting out fires, he reconciles inevitable surprises with the agenda the government hoped to implement.</p>
    
 
    <p>Ray Novak </p>
    
    <p>Principal secretary </p>
    
    <p>The only person in this photo who has been with Harper since before he became PM, Novak used to live in an apartment over the garage at Stornoway, so he could be on hand to help. Now  he is Harper’s most trusted personal adviser.</p>
    
 
    <p>Julie Vaux </p>
    
    <p>Press secretary  and junior French-language spokesperson</p>
