    <p>It stalked them all winter, its menace growing drip by drip—until finally, late last month, residents of a Saskatoon apartment complex went public with their fears that a giant icicle blooming from the side of a neighbouring building might pose a lethal threat. Three storeys tall and resembling a frozen waterfall, the unnatural wonder was the product of a leaky roof, missing drainpipe and the Saskatchewan sun. “That thing weighs a lot,” Henry Poitras complained to the <em>Saskatoon StarPhoenix</em>. “These walls are thin. It could come right through.” When an icicle half the size calved off the same building last winter, it shook the ground, sounding like a car crash, residents said. </p>
    
    <p>At first, city officials dismissed their concerns as a private matter. But as media attention grew—and the icicle acquired its own Twitter account—their resistance melted away. An inspector from the Saskatoon Fire Department was dispatched and ordered the immediate removal of the hanging hazard. </p>
    
    <p>Even then, it was no simple thing. On the first day, contractors hired by the building’s owner attacked the icicle with chainsaws and barely made a dent. (The water that flowed inside dulled the links almost instantly.) Heavier-duty equipment was brought in, buttressed by brute force and sledgehammers. And after three long days, the frozen stalactite, estimated to have weighed as much as two tonnes, was reduced to so many cubes. Residents proclaimed themselves relieved but fear the danger will return next year unless roof repairs are undertaken. </p>
    
    <p>This week, the fire department received another cold tip, of an ice curtain on the other side of town that had swallowed two parking spots—and counting.</p>
