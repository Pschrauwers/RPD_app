     <p>The crowning of an Ethiopian-born beauty queen last week marked a big step forward for Israel, where—disturbingly—appearance has come to count for a lot. The new Miss Israel, 21-year-old Yityish Aynaw, is one of tens of thousands of black Falasha Jews who have migrated to the Holy Land since the mid-1980s famine, yet who still struggle for acceptance in Israeli society. Many toil in low-paying jobs, while some have been shut out of housing complexes, with residents telling reporters they thought Ethiopians and their food were smelly. </p>
    
    <p>These episodes and others have forced Israel—founded to be a refuge from anti-Semitic persecution—to confront its own layers of xenophobia. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Ethiopian-Israelis employment programs, easier access to mortgages and allocated job slots in the civil service. De facto segregation remains: many Falasha live in poor neighbourhoods where their children attend all-black schools. But Aynaw hopes her success heralds a new spirit of cosmopolitanism. “There are many different communities of many different colours in Israel,” she said. “It’s important to show that to the world.”</p>
