    <p>To say that Hugo Chávez divided Venezuelans doesn’t do justice to the extremes of emotion he provoked in his fellow citizens. </p>
    
    <p>I once spent an evening with a wealthy woman in Caracas who made increasingly lurid and damning allegations about the president, culminating in an anecdote about a friend of a relative of a friend who supposedly knew Chávez and heard him express admiration for Adolf Hitler. </p>
    
    <p>This was preposterous, but then so was much of the hagiography that surrounded Chávez when he lived, and that will surely get kicked up a notch now. Chávez, who died March 5, at 58, was not a tyrant, but nor was he a saint who sought to liberate Venezuela’s poor and unite the country behind revolutionary socialism. That Venezuela is so split now at the moment of his death is the natural result of his own polarizing politics. </p>
    
    <p>Chávez was an autocratic populist who governed as if in the midst of a perpetual election campaign in which he was not constrained by normal democratic rules. For Chávez, Venezuelans could be divided between his supporters—Chavistas—and opponents. Most Chavistas were poor, and many benefited from his policies designed to help them. Chávez brought them subsidized food and more accessible health care. He built cable cars to connect residents of mountainside shantytowns to the centre of Caracas. </p>
    
    <p>But to Chávez the poor were also—and perhaps primarily—supporters to be mobilized. So many of his social programs were politicized. The committees administering them were linked to Chávez’s party. Schoolchildren learned to sing his praise. In one particularly telling incident, Venezuelans who signed a petition asking for a presidential recall referendum found themselves excluded from public service jobs—whether they were poor and in need of employment or not. </p>
    
    <p>The sad irony is that after 14 years with Chávez in power, Venezuelans are still poor. Wealth is now distributed more evenly, but there is less of it to go around. While the economies of neighbouring countries such as Brazil and Colombia have expanded over the past decade, Venezuela’s has stagnated. Chávez made economic decisions on the fly, sometimes announcing them during weekly unscripted televised addresses that also included the president singing and dancing. </p>
    
    <p>He devalued the currency. He nationalized the oil industry and managed it poorly. He didn’t diversify the country’s economy. Some 50 per cent of government revenue comes from oil. If its prices hadn’t have soared so high during his presidency, Venezuela would be in even worse financial shape than it is now. </p>
    
    <p>Hugo Chávez tried to raise Venezuela’s global profile by forging alliances with pretty much anyone opposed to the United States. His bonds with Fidel Castro’s Cuba at least made some ideological sense; those with the arch-conservative theocrats running Iran betray the amoral hypocrisy of his brand of socialism. </p>
    
    <p>If Chávez can be justifiably praised, it is for empowering Venezuela’s vast underclass. They had been variously cheated, exploited, and ignored before he came to power. They cannot be ignored any longer. With luck, a more democratic, liberal, and economically competent president will eventually take Chávez’s place without forgetting that lesson.</p>
