  <photo.caption>‘Last straw’: Seconds after another car passed by, a parked SUV crashed through the roof</photo.caption>
    
  <body.content>
    <p>In the end, the weight of a single car was enough to bring down a massive chunk of the rooftop parking lot. “The last straw,” according to a team of engineers who investigated last summer’s deadly mall collapse in Elliot Lake, Ont. </p>
    
    <p>A public inquiry into the Algo Centre cave-in that killed two women and injured 20 others has just begun. But one crucial fact—the specific, scientific cause of the catastrophe—is already clear, thanks in part to a chilling surveillance video that captured the implosion. “The trigger of the collapse on June 23, 2012, is quite evident,” concludes a 700-page report from Norr, a global engineering firm that conducted a forensic investigation for the Ontario Provincial Police. “The evidence of this is overwhelming.” </p>
    
    <p>The expert conclusion? Decades of water damage had so corroded the weld on one particular steel connector holding up the concrete that it couldn’t even withstand the pressure of a passing car. </p>
    
    <p>According to the report, one of hundreds of exhibits already filed at the inquiry, the main culprit was a rusty steel beam that ran directly above the mall’s lottery kiosk—ground zero for the eventual collapse. Both ends of the horizontal beam were bolted to steel connectors, which were then welded to structural columns protruding from the floor. From a strict engineering perspective, it was a sound design that met all necessary building code provisions. </p>
    
    <p>But in practice, the rooftop parking lot was an utter disaster, plagued by years of incessant leaks that allowed slush and rain to seep through the concrete slabs and slowly corrode the steel below. “By the day of the collapse,” the report says, “the welded connection had been so heavily depleted over years of corrosion that the passing car was the last straw that the connections could take.” </p>
    
    <p>A surveillance camera filmed that car as it drove over the doomed weld that Saturday afternoon. Barely 10 seconds later, at 2:18 p.m., the connection buckled, sending thousands of pounds of concrete and a parked SUV crashing down on two women: Lucie Aylwin, a 37-year-old bride-to-be who was working weekend shifts at the lottery kiosk to help pay for her wedding; and Doloris Perizzolo, 74, a widow and food-court regular who loved her scratch tickets.  </p>
    
    <p>The video has not been released yet, but the engineering report does include six horrifying snapshots. “The nature of the failure was sudden,” the report says, “and the duration of the collapse lasted only one second.” By the time anyone could react, it was over.     </p>
