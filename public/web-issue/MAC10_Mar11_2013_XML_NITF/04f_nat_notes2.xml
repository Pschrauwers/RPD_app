  <p>The RCMP have become increasingly fond of so-called “Mr. Big” operations, in which undercover cops lure a suspect into a phony criminal organization—then get the unwitting naïf to confess to past crimes by demanding he establish his bad-guy bona fides. Critics complain these charades amount to entrapment, and now their legality will be put to the test: the Supreme Court has said it will hear the case of Nelson Lloyd Hart, a Newfoundland man who confessed during a Mr. Big sting to drowning his twin three-year-old daughters, Karen and Krista.</p>
  
  <p>To some, the Hart saga highlights the problems with this investigative technique. The accused had a Grade 5 education, a gambling problem and was on social assistance at the time his girls died in Gander Lake in 2002. He told police he’d had an epileptic seizure and didn’t know how the girls ended up in the water. A social outcast, Hart may have been susceptible to the police method of building up a suspect’s self-esteem with expensive meals and fancy hotels, then threatening to take it all away unless he talks about his notorious past. When Mr. Big, an undercover officer, didn’t buy the seizure story, Hart said he killed the girls because his brother was about to take them away by having him declared an unfit parent.</p>
  
  <p>The three-judge appeal court didn’t accept Hart’s confession and they sent the case back for a new trial, saying “our justice system has rightly been concerned with the prospect of wrongful convictions.” The Crown appealed, and the high court will now consider whether the state abused its power. The result might not affect all such operations, but if the Supreme Court shares lower courts’ concerns, police might find Mr. Big a lot less helpful than he used to be.</p>
