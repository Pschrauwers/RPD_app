    <p>As social media-generated fast-food scandals go, the uproar over the length of Subway’s sandwiches is pretty tame stuff. Nobody was caught spitting on a pizza (Domino’s) or standing in a bucket of lettuce (Burger King). But a photo on Facebook that showed a “foot-long” sandwich measuring just 11 inches still managed to create a PR headache for the sandwich chain. A hundred thousand Facebook “likes” later, the story of the shrunken sub made it onto the <em>New York Post</em>’s front page. The tabloid found that four out of seven subs it tested in the Big Apple came up short. Subway told the Associated Press the small subs are unacceptable and blamed the discrepancy on inconsistent bread baking at its franchised locations, which it promised to try and fix. While some patrons appear to be getting shorted, it’s not all bad news: one Subway sub tested by <em>Maclean’s</em> measured in at a healthy 12.5 inches.
